prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	patient34	63	M	CAUC


response:
```
# Read the tab-separated file
subjects <- read.delim("subjects.txt")

# Get the number of rows and columns in the data frame
num_rows <- nrow(subjects)
num_cols <- ncol(subjects)

# Print the number of rows and columns
num_rows
num_cols
```

Note: Make sure to replace "subjects.txt" with the correct file path if it is in a different directory.
