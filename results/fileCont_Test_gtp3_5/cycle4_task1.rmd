prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	34	63	M	CAUC


response:
```
# Read the file
data <- read.delim("subjects.txt", sep = "\t")

# Get the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_cols <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of rows and columns
print(num_rows)
print(num_cols)
```
Alternatively, you can use the `dim()` function to get the number of rows and columns in a single line:
```
# Read the file
data <- read.delim("subjects.txt", sep = "\t")

# Get the dimensions
dimensions <- dim(data)

# Print the number of rows and columns
print(dimensions[1])
print(dimensions[2])
```
Note: Replace "subjects.txt" with the correct file path or make sure the file is in the working directory.
