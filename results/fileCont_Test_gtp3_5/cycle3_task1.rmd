here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race

response:
```
# Read the file
data <- read.table("subjects.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Check the number of rows and columns
rows <- nrow(data)
cols <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of rows and columns
print(paste("Number of rows:", rows))
print(paste("Number of columns:", cols))
```
Note: Make sure the "subjects.txt" file is in the current working directory of the R session.
