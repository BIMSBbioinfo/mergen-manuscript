prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	patient34	63	M	CAUC


response:
```
# Read the file
data <- read.table("subjects.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Calculate the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_cols <- ncol(data)

# Print the results
num_rows
num_cols
```
Note: Replace "subjects.txt" with the actual file path if it's not in the same directory as the R script.
