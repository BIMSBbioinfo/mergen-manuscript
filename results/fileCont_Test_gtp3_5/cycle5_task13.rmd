prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(openxlsx)

# Read count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", startRow = 2)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Rename the first column of annotation data to match with count table
colnames(annotation_data)[1] <- "Genes"

# Merge count table with annotation data based on the matching sample ids
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = "Genes", all.x = TRUE)

# Calculate the number of columns in the merged data
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```
