prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	patient34	63	M	CAUC


response:
```
# Read the subjects.txt file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows
num_rows <- nrow(subjects)

# Count the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(subjects)

# Print the number of rows and columns
num_rows
num_columns
```
Note: In the code, make sure to replace `"subjects.txt"` with the actual file path or use `setwd()` to set the working directory to the folder containing the file.
