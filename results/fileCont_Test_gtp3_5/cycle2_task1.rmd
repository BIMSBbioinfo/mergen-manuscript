here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race

response:
```
# Read the tab separated file
data <- read.table("subjects.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Get the number of rows and columns in the data
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_cols <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of rows and columns
