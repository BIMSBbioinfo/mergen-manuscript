prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Here is the R code to merge the annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate the number of columns:

```
# Read the count table and annotation data
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheetName = 1, header = TRUE)
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Merge the count table and annotation data
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = 0, all = TRUE)
merged_data <- merged_data[, -1]

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```

Note: This code assumes that you have the `openxlsx` package installed and loaded in your R environment. If not, you can install it using ``.
