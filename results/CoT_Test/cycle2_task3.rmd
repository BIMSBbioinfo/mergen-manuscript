prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the R programming language and the `readxl` package to read the Excel file and extract the necessary information.

First, let's install and load the `readxl` package:
```
install.packages("readxl")  # Install the readxl package if not already installed
library(readxl)             # Load the readxl package
```

Next, we can read the Excel file and store the data in a dataframe:
```
# Replace "path_to_file" with the actual path to the Excel file
data <- read_excel("path_to_file/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

To determine the number of genes, we can count the number of rows in the dataframe minus 1 (to exclude the header row):
```
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1
```

To determine the number of samples, we can count the number of columns in the dataframe minus 1 (to exclude the first column which contains gene names):
```
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1
```

Finally, we can output the results:
```
num_genes  # Number of genes
num_samples  # Number of samples
```

The code provided above will read the Excel file and determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset. Make sure to replace `"path_to_file"` with the actual path to the Excel file before running the code.
