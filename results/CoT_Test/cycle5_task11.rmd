prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each, we can use the `read.table()` function in R to read the tables and the `dim()` function to count the number of rows and columns.

First, let's read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file and count the number of rows and columns:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
met_table <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns
met_rows <- nrow(met_table)
met_cols <- ncol(met_table)

# Print the number of rows and columns
cat("Number of rows in met_table:", met_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in met_table:", met_cols, "\n")
```

Next, let's read the "subjects.txt" file and count the number of rows and columns:

```
# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects_table <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns
subjects_rows <- nrow(subjects_table)
subjects_cols <- ncol(subjects_table)

# Print the number of rows and columns
cat("Number of rows in subjects_table:", subjects_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in subjects_table:", subjects_cols, "\n")
```

Please make sure to replace the file names in the `read.table()` functions with the actual file names or provide the correct path to the files if they are not in the current working directory.
