prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read and analyze the count table and annotation data, you can use the `readxl` package in R for reading Excel files and the `readr` package for reading tab-separated values (tsv) files. 

First, install and load the required packages:

```
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("readr")

library(readxl)
library(readr)
```

Next, read the count table and annotation data:

```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

To count the number of rows and columns in each data frame, you can use the `dim` function in R. 

```
# Count number of rows and columns in the count table
count_rows <- dim(count_table)[1]
count_columns <- dim(count_table)[2]

# Count number of rows and columns in the annotation data
annotation_rows <- dim(annotation_data)[1]
annotation_columns <- dim(annotation_data)[2]
```

Finally, you can print the results:

```
# Print the count table dimensions
cat("Count table has", count_rows, "rows and", count_columns, "columns.\n")

# Print the annotation data dimensions
cat("Annotation data has", annotation_rows, "rows and", annotation_columns, "columns.\n")
```

The code provided above will read the count table and annotation data, and then count the number of rows and columns in each data frame. The dimensions of the count table and annotation data will be printed as output.

Note: Make sure the files "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" are located in your working directory or provide the correct file paths accordingly.
