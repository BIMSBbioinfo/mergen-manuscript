prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table and plot boxplots based on the group variable, we can follow these steps:

1. Load the required libraries: We will use the `tidyverse` package for data manipulation and visualization, and the `readxl` package to read the Excel file.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data: We will read the Excel file using the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package. Replace `"path/to/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the actual path to your count table file. Similarly, replace `"path/to/SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual path to your annotation data file.

```
count_table <- read_excel("path/to/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("path/to/SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

3. Merge the count table and annotation data: We can join the two datasets using the common sample IDs. Assuming the sample IDs are stored in the first column of the annotation data, we can use the `left_join()` function from the `dplyr` package to perform the merge.

```
merged_data <- left_join(count_table, annotation_data, by = c("Sample" = "Sample_ID"))
```

4. Plot boxplots: We will use the `ggplot2` package to create the boxplots and color code them based on the `group` variable from the annotation data. Assuming the gene expression values are in the columns corresponding to the samples (excluding the first column for gene names and the last column for the group variable), we can reshape the data into a long format using the `pivot_longer()` function. Then, we can plot the boxplots using `geom_boxplot()` and assign colors to the boxes using the `fill` aesthetic.

```
library(ggplot2)

# Reshape the data into long format
long_data <- merged_data %>%
  select(-Gene) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(group), names_to = "Sample", values_to = "Expression")

# Plot boxplots
ggplot(long_data, aes(x = group, y = Expression, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Replace `"Gene"` with the actual column name for the gene names in the count table. Adjust the labels and theme as per your preference.

Note: Make sure to install the required packages using `install.packages()` if you haven't already. Also, adjust the file paths and column names based on your specific dataset.
