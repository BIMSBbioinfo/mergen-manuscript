prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each, you can use the following code in R:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" table
met_table <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in met_table
num_rows_met <- nrow(met_table)
num_cols_met <- ncol(met_table)

# Read the "subjects.txt" table
subject_table <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in subject_table
num_rows_subject <- nrow(subject_table)
num_cols_subject <- ncol(subject_table)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
print(paste("Number of rows and columns in met_table:", num_rows_met, num_cols_met))
print(paste("Number of rows and columns in subject_table:", num_rows_subject, num_cols_subject))
```

Make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file names and the correct file paths if necessary.
