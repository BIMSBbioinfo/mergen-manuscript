prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

response:
To determine the number of rows and columns in the "subjects.txt" file, you can use the `read.table()` function in R. Here's the code:

```
# Read the file
data <- read.table("subjects.txt", sep = "\t")

# Get the number of rows and columns in the file
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_columns <- ncol(data)

# Print the result
num_rows
num_columns
```

By using the above code, you will be able to obtain the number of rows and columns in the "subjects.txt" file.
