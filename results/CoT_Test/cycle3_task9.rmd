prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To accomplish the task, we will follow these steps:
1. Read the gene expression data from the file "leukemiaExp.txt" into a dataframe.
2. Calculate the variability of each gene and select the top 1000 most variable genes.
3. Create a heatmap of the selected genes with clustering.
4. Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the samples and create a plot.

Here's the code to achieve this:

```
# Step 1: Read the gene expression data into a dataframe
gene_data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Step 2: Filter genes based on variability
gene_variability <- apply(gene_data[, -1], 1, var)  # Calculate variance for each gene
top_variable_genes <- names(sort(gene_variability, decreasing = TRUE))[1:1000]  # Get top 1000 genes

# Subset the gene data to include only the top variable genes
gene_data_filtered <- gene_data[c("GENE_NAME", top_variable_genes)]

# Step 3: Create a heatmap with clustering
library(gplots)  # Required for heatmap
heatmap_data <- gene_data_filtered[, -1]  # Exclude the gene names column
heatmap_clusters <- hclust(dist(heatmap_data))  # Perform hierarchical clustering
heatmap_colors <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(n = 9, name = "Blues"))(50)  # Specify color palette
heatmap(gene_data_filtered[, -1], col = heatmap_colors, Rowv = as.dendrogram(heatmap_clusters),
        main = "Heatmap of Top Variable Genes", xlab = "Samples", ylab = "Genes")

# Step 4: Perform PCA and create a plot
library(ggplot2)  # Required for plotting
pca_data <- gene_data_filtered[, -1]  # Exclude the gene names column
pca_result <- prcomp(pca_data, scale. = TRUE)  # Perform PCA with scaling
pca_plot <- ggplot(data = pca_result$x, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot of Samples", x = "PC1", y = "PC2")
print(pca_plot)
```

Please note that the code assumes that necessary libraries (`gplots` and `ggplot2`) are already installed. If they are not, you can install them by running `install.packages("gplots")` and `install.packages("ggplot2")` respectively before executing the code.
