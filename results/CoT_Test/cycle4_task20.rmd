prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To solve this task, we can follow these steps:

1. Load the count table and annotation data.
2. Identify the groups in the annotation data.
3. Perform statistical tests to find genes specific to each group.
4. Extract the group-specific genes from the count table.
5. Perform PCA using the group-specific genes.
6. Plot the PCA with color-coded groups.

Let's start by loading the count table and annotation data.  

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Load count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Load annotation data
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

Next, let's identify the groups in the annotation data.

```
# Find unique groups in the annotation data
groups <- unique(annotation_data$group)
```

Now, we can perform statistical tests to find genes specific to each group. We will use an appropriate statistical test such as t-test or DESeq2 analysis, depending on the nature of the data. For simplicity, let's assume we will use a t-test.

```
# Perform t-test for each group
group_specific_genes <- list()

for (group in groups) {
  # Subset count table for the current group
  group_counts <- count_table[, annotation_data$group == group]
  
  # Perform t-test for each gene
  t_test_results <- apply(group_counts, 1, function(gene_counts) {
    t.test(gene_counts ~ group)$p.value
  })
  
  # Select genes with a significant p-value
  significant_genes <- names(t_test_results)[t_test_results < 0.05]
  
  # Store significant genes for the current group
  group_specific_genes[[group]] <- significant_genes
}
```

After finding the group-specific genes, we can extract them from the count table.

```
# Create a new count table with group-specific genes
group_specific_count_table <- count_table[group_specific_genes[[1]], ]

# Add count columns for other groups
for (i in 2:length(groups)) {
  group_specific_count_table <- cbind(group_specific_count_table, 
                                      count_table[group_specific_genes[[i]], ])
}
```

Now, let's perform PCA using the group-specific genes and color code the PCA by the "group" variable in the annotation data.

```
# Perform PCA using prcomp
pca <- prcomp(t(group_specific_count_table))

# Plot the PCA with color-coded groups
plot(pca$x[, 1], pca$x[, 2], col = annotation_data$group, pch = 16, 
     xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
```

And that's it! We have performed statistical tests to find genes specific for each group, extracted the group-specific genes, and plotted the PCA with color-coded groups.

Please note that this code assumes that the count table and annotation data are formatted correctly. You may need to modify the code if your data has different structures or formats.
