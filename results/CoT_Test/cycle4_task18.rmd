prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapId.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we need to perform a merge operation between the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" datasets based on the "dbGap ID" column. Then, we can filter the merged dataset to include only CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race. Finally, we can display the top 20 CpGs.

Here's the step-by-step solution in R:

1. Read the datasets into data frames:

```
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)
```

2. Merge the datasets based on the "dbGap ID" column:

```
merged <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = 1, by.y = 2, all.x = TRUE)
```

3. Filter the merged dataset to include only CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race:

```
filtered <- subset(merged, !is.na(Age) & is.na(sex) & is.na(Race))
```

4. Sort the filtered dataset based on CpG methylation values (assuming they are in a column named "methylation"):

```
sorted <- filtered[order(filtered$methylation, decreasing = TRUE), ]
```

5. Display the top 20 CpGs:

```
top_20_cpgs <- head(sorted$CpG_id, 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

Here's the complete code:

```
# Step 1: Read the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Step 2: Merge the datasets
merged <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = 1, by.y = 2, all.x = TRUE)

# Step 3: Filter the merged dataset
filtered <- subset(merged, !is.na(Age) & is.na(sex) & is.na(Race))

# Step 4: Sort the filtered dataset
sorted <- filtered[order(filtered$methylation, decreasing = TRUE), ]

# Step 5: Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(sorted$CpG_id, 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

Please note that you may need to adjust the column names in the code based on your actual datasets.
