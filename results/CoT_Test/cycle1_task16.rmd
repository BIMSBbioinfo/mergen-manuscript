prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, we can use the merge function in R. Here are the steps to perform the task:

1. Load the required libraries:
```
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

2. Read the count table from the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" file:
```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

3. Read the annotation data from the "SRP021193.colData.tsv" file:
```
annotation_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", delim = "\t")
```

4. Merge the count table and annotation data using the common sample IDs:
```
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = "sample.ids")
```

5. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color-coded based on the "group" variable in the annotation data:
```
boxplot(merged_data[, 2:ncol(merged_data)], col = merged_data$group)
```

The ```merged_data[, 2:ncol(merged_data)]``` selects all the columns from the second column (gene expression values) to the last column (sample annotations) in the merged data. We use the "col" argument in the boxplot function to assign colors based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.

Full code:
```
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", delim = "\t")
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = "sample.ids")
boxplot(merged_data[, 2:ncol(merged_data)], col = merged_data$group)
```

Make sure to replace the file paths ("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv") with the actual paths to the files on your system.
