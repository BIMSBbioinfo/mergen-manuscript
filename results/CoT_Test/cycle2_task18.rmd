prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapId.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we need to perform a data analysis on the provided datasets. Here's the step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file to load the methylation data.
2. Read the "subjects.txt" file to load the information on the individuals.
3. Match the dbGap IDs from the subjects dataset with the first row of the methylation data to ensure they represent the same individuals.
4. Filter the CpGs based on the criteria of being associated with Age but not with sex or Race.
5. Display the top 20 CpGs.

Here's the code to accomplish the task:

```
# Step 1: Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Step 2: Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Step 3: Match dbGap IDs to ensure they represent the same individuals
matched_methylation_data <- methylation_data[, subjects_data$`dbGap ID`]

# Step 4: Filter CpGs based on Age but not sex or Race
filtered_cpgs <- subset(matched_methylation_data, select = startsWith(names(matched_methylation_data), "CpG_id") & !startsWith(names(matched_methylation_data), "Age_") & !(startsWith(names(matched_methylation_data), "sex_") | startsWith(names(matched_methylation_data), "Race_")))

# Step 5: Display top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_cpgs, 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

Make sure to replace the file paths in the `read.table` functions with the actual paths to your files.

This code will load the datasets, match the dbGap IDs, filter the CpGs based on the provided criteria, and display the top 20 CpGs meeting the requirements.
