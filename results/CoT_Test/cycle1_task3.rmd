prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then extract the necessary information.

First, let's install and load the `readxl` package:

```
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
```

Next, we can use the `read_excel()` function to read the Excel file and store the data in a variable:

```
gene_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

To find the number of genes and samples, we can use the `dim()` function, which gives the dimensions of the matrix, where the number of rows represents the number of genes and the number of columns represents the number of samples:

```
num_genes <- dim(gene_data)[1]
num_samples <- dim(gene_data)[2]

num_genes  # Number of genes
num_samples  # Number of samples
```

This code will give you the number of genes and samples in the dataset.
