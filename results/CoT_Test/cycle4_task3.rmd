prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To find the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we will use the `readxl` package in R to import the excel file and then analyze the dimensions of the data.

Here's how you can do it step-by-step:

1. Install and load the `readxl` package:
```
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
```

2. Read the excel file into R using the `read_excel()` function:
```
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

3. Check the dimensions of the data using the `dim()` function:
```
num_genes <- dim(data)[1]
num_samples <- dim(data)[2]
```

4. Print the results:
```
num_genes
num_samples
```

The code will read the excel file and store it in the `data` variable. Then, we use the `dim()` function to extract the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the dataset. Finally, we print the values of `num_genes` and `num_samples`.

Full Code:
```
# Install and load the readxl package
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file into R
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Calculate the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- dim(data)[1]
num_samples <- dim(data)[2]

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```

Please make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the correct file name and path to the file in your system.
