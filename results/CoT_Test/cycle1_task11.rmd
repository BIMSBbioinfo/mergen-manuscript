prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each, we can use the read.table() function in R. Here is the code to accomplish this:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
met_file <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of rows and columns
met_rows <- nrow(met_file)
met_cols <- ncol(met_file)

# Print the results
print(paste("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt has", met_rows, "rows and", met_cols, "columns."))

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subj_file <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of rows and columns
subj_rows <- nrow(subj_file)
subj_cols <- ncol(subj_file)

# Print the results
print(paste("subjects.txt has", subj_rows, "rows and", subj_cols, "columns."))
```

This code reads the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" files using the read.table() function, specifying that the files are tab-separated and have a header row. It then counts the number of rows and columns in each table using the nrow() and ncol() functions. Finally, it prints the results using the paste() and print() functions.
