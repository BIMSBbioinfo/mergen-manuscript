prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables in R, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the required libraries, including the `readxl` library for reading Excel files and the `tidyverse` library for data manipulation:

```
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data into data frames:

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", delim = "\t")
```

3. Rename the first column of the annotation data to match the column names in the count table:

```
colnames(annotation_data)[1] <- colnames(count_table)[1]
```

4. Merge the count table and annotation data based on the matching sample ids:

```
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = "SampleId")
```

5. Calculate the number of columns in the merged data:

```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

6. Print the number of columns:

```
print(num_columns)
```

Here is the complete code:

```
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", delim = "\t")

colnames(annotation_data)[1] <- colnames(count_table)[1]

merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = "SampleId")

num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

print(num_columns)
```

Please make sure to adjust the file paths in the `read_excel()` and `read_delim()` functions to match the actual file locations on your system.
