prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, we can use the sample ids as the key to match the rows. I assume the count table is in a tab-separated values (tsv) format, and the annotation data is also in a tsv format.

Here are the steps to merge the data and plot the boxplots:

1. Read the count table and annotation data into R.

```
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

2. Make sure the sample ids in the count table and annotation data match.

```
# Convert column names of count table to match annotation_data
colnames(count_table)[-1] <- annotation_data[, 1]

# Remove any extra samples in count table if necessary
count_table <- count_table[, colnames(count_table) %in% annotation_data[, 1]]
```

3. Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample ids.

```
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "SampleID", by.y = "Sample_ID", all.x = TRUE)
```

4. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.

```
library(ggplot2)

# Reshape merged data to long format for boxplotting
merged_data_long <- tidyr::gather(merged_data, "gene", "expression", -SampleID, -group)

# Plot boxplots
ggplot(merged_data_long, aes(x = group, y = expression, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  ggtitle("Gene Expression Boxplots per Sample") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This code assumes that you have the necessary packages installed, such as `tidyr` and `ggplot2`. If you don't have them installed, you can install them using the `install.packages()` function before running the code.
