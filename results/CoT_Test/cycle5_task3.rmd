prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then count the number of rows and columns in the dataset.

First, make sure you have the `readxl` package installed by running the following code:
```
install.packages("readxl")
```

Next, load the `readxl` package and read the Excel file using the `read_excel()` function. Specify the path to your Excel file and sheet name (if applicable) in the function arguments. In this case, we will assume that the sheet name is "Sheet1":
```
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
gene_exp_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1")
```

Now, we can determine the number of genes and samples by counting the rows and columns in the dataset using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions, respectively:
```
# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(gene_exp_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(gene_exp_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the gene name column

num_genes  # Display the number of genes
num_samples  # Display the number of samples
```

The `num_genes` variable will give you the number of genes in the dataset, and the `num_samples` variable will give you the number of samples.

Here is the complete code:
```
# Install and load the readxl package
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
gene_exp_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(gene_exp_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(gene_exp_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the gene name column

num_genes  # Display the number of genes
num_samples  # Display the number of samples
```
Note: Replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the correct path to your Excel file. Also, adjust the sheet name if it is different in your file.
