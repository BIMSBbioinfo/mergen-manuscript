prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, follow these steps:

1. Load the necessary libraries in R:
```
library(readxl)    # for reading Excel files
library(tidyverse) # for data manipulation
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data into separate data frames:
```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

3. Check the structure and contents of the count table and annotation data:
```
str(count_table)        # to see the structure of count table
head(count_table)       # to see the first few rows of count table
str(annotation_data)    # to see the structure of annotation data
head(annotation_data)   # to see the first few rows of annotation data
```

4. Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample column:
```
merged_data <- count_table %>%
  left_join(annotation_data, by = c("sample" = "sample_id"))
```

5. Calculate the number of columns in the merged data:
```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

6. Print the number of columns:
```
num_columns
```

Here is the complete code:

```
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Read the count table and annotation data
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Check the structure and contents of the count table and annotation data
str(count_table)
head(count_table)
str(annotation_data)
head(annotation_data)

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample column
merged_data <- count_table %>%
  left_join(annotation_data, by = c("sample" = "sample_id"))

# Calculate the number of columns in the merged data
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```

Make sure to provide the correct file paths for the count table and annotation data in the `read_excel` and `read_tsv` functions, respectively.
