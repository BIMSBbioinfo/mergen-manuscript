prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

response:
To read the "subjects.txt" file and determine the number of rows and columns, we can use the `read.table()` function in R. Here's the code:

```
# Read the file
data <- read.table("subjects.txt", sep="\t")

# Check the dimensions of the data
n_rows <- nrow(data)
n_cols <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of rows and columns
cat("Number of rows:", n_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns:", n_cols)
```

Make sure to replace `"subjects.txt"` in the code with the actual path or filename of your "subjects.txt" file.
