prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each, we can use the `read.table()` function in R to read the files and the `dim()` function to count the number of rows and columns.

Here's how you can do it step by step:

Step 1: Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file using the `read.table()` function:
```
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
```

Step 2: Count the number of rows and columns in the "metRmOl" dataset using the `dim()` function:
```
metRmOl_rows <- dim(metRmOl)[1]
metRmOl_cols <- dim(metRmOl)[2]
```

Step 3: Read the "subjects.txt" file using the `read.table()` function:
```
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)
```

Step 4: Count the number of rows and columns in the "subjects" dataset using the `dim()` function:
```
subjects_rows <- dim(subjects)[1]
subjects_cols <- dim(subjects)[2]
```

Step 5: Print the number of rows and columns for each dataset:
```
print(paste("metRmOl has", metRmOl_rows, "rows and", metRmOl_cols, "columns"))
print(paste("subjects has", subjects_rows, "rows and", subjects_cols, "columns"))
```

This code will read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each dataset. You can replace the file names "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file names you have.

Note: Make sure the file paths are correct and that the files are in the current working directory or provide the full path to the files.
