prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read and analyze the datasets, we can use the `read.table()` function in R. Here are the steps to read the two datasets and count the number of rows and columns for each:

Step 1: Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" dataset
```
# Read table from file
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count number of rows and columns
num_rows_met <- nrow(met_data)
num_cols_met <- ncol(met_data)
```

Step 2: Read the "subjects.txt" dataset
```
# Read table from file
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count number of rows and columns
num_rows_subject <- nrow(subject_data)
num_cols_subject <- ncol(subject_data)
```

Code to Count number of rows and columns for each dataset:

```
# Count number of rows and columns for each dataset
num_rows_met
num_cols_met

num_rows_subject
num_cols_subject
```

Explanation:

In Step 1, we use the `read.table()` function to read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file. The `header = TRUE` argument indicates that the first row of the file contains column names. The `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` argument ensures that character strings are read as characters and not as factors.
We then use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions to count the number of rows and columns in the "met_data" dataset, and store the results in the variables "num_rows_met" and "num_cols_met", respectively.

In Step 2, we follow the same steps to read the "subjects.txt" file. We use the `header = TRUE` argument to indicate that the first row of the file contains column names, and the `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` argument to read character strings as characters.
We again use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions to count the number of rows and columns in the "subject_data" dataset, and store the results in the variables "num_rows_subject" and "num_cols_subject", respectively.

Finally, we display the number of rows and columns for each dataset by printing the values of the variables "num_rows_met", "num_cols_met", "num_rows_subject", and "num_cols_subject".

Note: Make sure to replace the file paths in the `read.table()` functions with the actual paths to the files on your computer.
