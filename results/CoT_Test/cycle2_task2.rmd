prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can write a simple R script to read the file and count the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the dataset.

Here's the code to achieve this:

```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
expression_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(expression_data)
num_samples <- ncol(expression_data)

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```

You can replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file name and path, if it's stored in a different location. Running this code will provide the number of genes and samples in the dataset.
