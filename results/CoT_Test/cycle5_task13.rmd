prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, we will use the sample IDs as the common identifier. We will then calculate the number of columns in the merged table.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Load the required packages for data manipulation in R. In this case, we will use the `readxl` and `tidyverse` packages.

```
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

2. Read the count table from the Excel file using the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package. Replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the appropriate file path.

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

3. Read the annotation data from the TSV file using the `read_delim()` function from the `readr` package. Replace `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the appropriate file path.

```
annotation_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", delim = "\t")
```

4. Transpose the annotation data so that the sample IDs become row names using the `t()` function.

```
annotation_data <- t(annotation_data)
```

5. Set the column names of the count table to be the gene names using the first column of the count table.

```
colnames(count_table) <- count_table[, 1]
```

6. Remove the first column from the count table as it is now redundant.

```
count_table <- count_table[, -1]
```

7. Merge the count table and annotation data using the sample IDs as the common identifier. We will use the `merge()` function from the `tidyverse` package.

```
merged_table <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = "row.names", all = TRUE)
```

8. Calculate the number of columns in the merged table using the `ncol()` function.

```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_table)
```

9. Print the number of columns.

```
num_columns
```

Here is the complete code:

```
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", delim = "\t")
annotation_data <- t(annotation_data)
colnames(count_table) <- count_table[, 1]
count_table <- count_table[, -1]
merged_table <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = "row.names", all = TRUE)
num_columns <- ncol(merged_table)
num_columns
```

Make sure to replace the file paths `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the appropriate paths in your system.
