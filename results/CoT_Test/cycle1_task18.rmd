prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapId.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To solve this task, we will follow these steps:

1. Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file containing CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual.
2. Read the "subjects.txt" file containing information on the individuals.
3. Filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race.
4. Display the top 20 CpGs.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
# Step 1: Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Step 2: Read the "subjects.txt" file
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Step 3: Filter CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
cpgs_age_only <- subset(methylation_data, dbGap.ID %in% subject_data$dbGap.ID & !(dbGap.ID %in% subject_data$sex) & !(dbGap.ID %in% subject_data$Race))

# Step 4: Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs_age_only <- head(cpgs_age_only, 20)

print(top_20_cpgs_age_only)
```

Make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the appropriate file paths to your datasets.
