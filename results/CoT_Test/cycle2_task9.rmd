prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To accomplish this task, we will use R programming language and the following packages: `tidyverse` for data manipulation and visualization, `heatmaply` for plotting the heatmap, and `ggplot2` for plotting the PCA.

Here are the steps to filter genes based on their variability and plot the heatmap and PCA:

1. Install and load the required packages:
```
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("heatmaply")
```

```
library(tidyverse)
library(heatmaply)
```

2. Read the gene expression data from "leukemiaExp.txt" into a data frame:
```
leukemiaExp <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

3. Remove any missing values (NA) and transpose the data frame so that the samples are in rows and genes are in columns:
```
leukemiaExp_clean <- leukemiaExp %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  t()
```

4. Calculate the standard deviation for each gene:
```
gene_sd <- apply(leukemiaExp_clean, 2, sd)
```

5. Sort the genes based on their standard deviation in descending order and select the top 1000 most variable genes:
```
top_variable_genes <- names(sort(gene_sd, decreasing = TRUE))[1:1000]
```

6. Subset the gene expression data to include only the top variable genes:
```
leukemiaExp_filtered <- leukemiaExp_clean[top_variable_genes, ]
```

7. Plot the heatmap with clustering using the filtered gene expression data:
```
heatmaply(leukemiaExp_filtered)
```

8. Calculate the principal components for the samples using the filtered gene expression data:
```
pca <- prcomp(t(leukemiaExp_filtered))
```

9. Extract the scores for the first two principal components:
```
pca_scores <- data.frame(Sample = rownames(pca$x), PC1 = pca$x[, 1], PC2 = pca$x[, 2])
```

10. Plot the PCA using the scores:
```
ggplot(pca_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Sample)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```

This code will filter genes based on their variability, plot a heatmap with clustering using the top 1000 most variable genes, and plot the PCA for the samples.
