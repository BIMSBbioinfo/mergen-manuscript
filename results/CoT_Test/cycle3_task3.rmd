prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can make use of the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then count the number of rows and columns in the dataset.

First, let's install the `readxl` package if it is not already installed:

```
install.packages("readxl")
```

Next, we can load the `readxl` package and read the Excel file:

```
library(readxl)

# Specify the path to the Excel file
file_path <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel(file_path)
```

Now, let's determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset:

```
# Extract the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column (gene names)

# Print the number of genes and samples
num_genes
num_samples
```

This code will output the number of genes and samples in the dataset. Note that we subtract 1 from the number of rows and columns to exclude the header row and the first column (gene names) from the count.

Full code:
```
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

# Specify the path to the Excel file
file_path <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel(file_path)

# Extract the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column (gene names)

# Print the number of genes and samples
num_genes
num_samples
```
