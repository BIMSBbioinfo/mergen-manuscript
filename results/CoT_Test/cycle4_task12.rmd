prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data in R and count the number of rows and columns for each, you can follow these steps:

1. Install and load the required packages: `readxl` for reading Excel files and `data.table` for working with data tables efficiently.

```
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("data.table")

library(readxl)
library(data.table)
```

2. Read the count table from the Excel file "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and assign it to a variable, such as `count_table`.

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

3. Count the number of rows and columns in the count table using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions.

```
num_rows_count_table <- nrow(count_table)
num_cols_count_table <- ncol(count_table)
```

4. Read the annotation data from the TSV file "SRP021193.colData.tsv" using the `fread()` function from the `data.table` package, and assign it to a variable, such as `annotation_data`.

```
annotation_data <- fread("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

5. Count the number of rows and columns in the annotation data using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions.

```
num_rows_annotation_data <- nrow(annotation_data)
num_cols_annotation_data <- ncol(annotation_data)
```

6. Print the number of rows and columns for each table.

```
# Count table
cat("Count table has", num_rows_count_table, "rows and", num_cols_count_table, "columns.\n")

# Annotation data
cat("Annotation data has", num_rows_annotation_data, "rows and", num_cols_annotation_data, "columns.\n")
```

By following these steps, you will be able to read the count table and annotation data, and count the number of rows and columns for each.
