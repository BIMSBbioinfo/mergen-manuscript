prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To accomplish this task, we will use the following steps:

1. Load the required libraries for reading the data and performing PCA analysis.
2. Read the count table and annotation data.
3. Normalize the counts using a suitable method.
4. Perform PCA analysis on the normalized counts.
5. Create two PCA plots, one color-coded by "group" and the other color-coded by "LibrarySelection" in the annotation data.

Now, let's begin with the first step and load the necessary libraries:

```
# Step 1: Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(PCAtools)
```

Next, we will read the count table and annotation data:

```
# Step 2: Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

Now, let's normalize the counts using a suitable method. In this example, we will use the `voom` method from the `limma` package for normalization:

```
# Step 3: Normalize counts
normalized_counts <- limma::voom(count_table)
```

We will now perform PCA analysis on the normalized counts:

```
# Step 4: Perform PCA analysis
pca_result <- PCA(normalized_counts)
```

Finally, we will create two PCA plots, one color-coded by "group" and the other color-coded by "LibrarySelection" in the annotation data:

```
# Step 5: Create PCA plots
plotPCA(pca_result, group = annotation_data$group)
plotPCA(pca_result, group = annotation_data$LibrarySelection)
```

And that's it! You now have the code to normalize counts, perform PCA analysis, and create two PCA plots color-coded by different annotations in your data.

Please note that this code assumes that the count table file is in Excel format and the annotation data file is a tab-separated value (TSV) file. Make sure to adjust the file paths and formats as per your specific data files.
