prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in each of the two files, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv", we can use the following R code:

```
# Load necessary packages
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Count the number of rows and columns in the count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the annotation data
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the counts
cat("Count table has", count_rows, "rows and", count_cols, "columns\n")
cat("Annotation data has", annotation_rows, "rows and", annotation_cols, "columns\n")
```

Make sure to replace the file paths with the actual paths to your files. This code reads the count table using the `read_excel` function from the `readxl` package and the annotation data using the `read.delim` function. Then, it counts the number of rows and columns in each table using the `nrow` and `ncol` functions. Finally, it prints the counts using the `cat` function.

Note: The `read_excel` function requires the `readxl` package. If you haven't installed it, you can do so by running `install.packages("readxl")` before running the code.
