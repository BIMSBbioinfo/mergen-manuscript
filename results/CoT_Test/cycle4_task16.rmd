prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, we can use the gene names as the common column. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

Step 1: Read the count table and annotation data from the provided files.
```
library(readxl)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

Step 2: Check the structure of the count table and annotation data to ensure they are loaded correctly.
```
str(count_table)
str(annotation_data)
```

Step 3: Merge the count table and annotation data using the gene names as the common column.
```
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "Gene Names", by.y = "Sample ID", all.x = TRUE)
```

Step 4: Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.
```
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = Group, y = Gene_Names, fill = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "blue"))  # Adjust the colors as desired
```

This code assumes that the gene names in the count table match the sample IDs in the annotation data. Make sure to update the file paths if necessary and adjust the code according to your data structure.
