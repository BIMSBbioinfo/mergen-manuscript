prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Load the necessary library
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Determine the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples)
genes <- nrow(data) - 1 # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
genes
samples
```
This code assumes that the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" file is located in the current working directory. If the file is located in a different directory, you can specify the full file path in the `read_excel()` function.
