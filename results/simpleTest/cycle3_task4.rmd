prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment,"SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the count table from file
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the count table
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2  # Subtract 2 to exclude the first and last columns

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
Note: Replace "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" with the actual file path to the count table.
