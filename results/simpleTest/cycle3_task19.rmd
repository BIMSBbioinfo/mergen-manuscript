prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Read count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# Normalize counts using DESeq2
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table,
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~ 1)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA on normalized counts
pca_data <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Create a dataframe for plotting
pca_df <- data.frame(SampleID = rownames(pca_data$x),
                     PC1 = pca_data$x[,1],
                     PC2 = pca_data$x[,2],
                     Group = annotation_data$group,
                     LibrarySelection = annotation_data$LibrarySelection)

# Plot PCA colored by "group"
ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Group)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("PC 1") +
  ylab("PC 2") +
  ggtitle("PCA colored by Group")

# Plot PCA colored by "LibrarySelection"
ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("PC 1") +
  ylab("PC 2") +
  ggtitle("PCA colored by LibrarySelection")
```
Note: Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths in your system.
