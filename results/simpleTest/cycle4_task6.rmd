prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from a text file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Check the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# If there are more than 500 samples, randomly sample 500 samples
if (num_samples > 500) {
  set.seed(123)  # Set a seed for reproducibility
  sampled_columns <- sample(1:num_samples, 500)
  subset_data <- data[, sampled_columns]
} else {
  subset_data <- data  # No need to subset, use the original data
}

# View the subsetted data
subset_data
```
Note: Replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file path of your "leukemiaExp.txt" file.
