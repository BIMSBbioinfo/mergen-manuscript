prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Load gene expression data from file
data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Check the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# If there are more than 500 samples
if(num_samples > 500) {
  # Generate a random sample of 500 sample indices
  sample_indices <- sample(1:num_samples, 500)
  
  # Create a subset of the data using the sampled indices
  subset_data <- data[, sample_indices]
} else {
  # Otherwise, keep the original data
  subset_data <- data
}

# Print the subset of the data
subset_data
```
