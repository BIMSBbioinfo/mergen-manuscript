prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Check the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# If there are more than 500 samples, randomly sample 500 samples and create a subset
if(num_samples > 500) {
  # Set the seed for reproducibility
  set.seed(123)
  
  # Randomly select 500 sample indices
  sample_indices <- sample(num_samples, 500)
  
  # Create a subset of the data with the randomly selected samples
  data_subset <- data[, sample_indices]
  
  # Print the subsetted data
  print(data_subset)
} else {
  # If there are less than or equal to 500 samples, the subset is the original data
  data_subset <- data
  
  # Print the original data
  print(data_subset)
}
```
