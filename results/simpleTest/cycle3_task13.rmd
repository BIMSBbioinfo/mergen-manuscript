prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
```
# Load necessary packages
library(readxl)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Extract sample IDs from annotation data
sample_ids <- annotation_data[, 1]

# Merge count table and annotation data
merged_data <- cbind(annotation_data, count_table[, sample_ids])

# Calculate number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```
```
