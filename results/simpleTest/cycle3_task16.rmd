prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table and annotation data
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Rename the first column of the count table to "Gene"
colnames(count_table)[1] <- "Gene"

# Merge annotation data and gene expression table
merged_table <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = "row.names", all = TRUE)

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code based on "group" variable
ggplot(merged_table, aes(x = Sample_ID, y = log2(counts), fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Sample ID", y = "Log2(Expression Counts)", fill = "Group")
```

Please note that you may need to modify the code slightly based on the file formats of your count table and annotation data. Also, you may need to install the necessary libraries (`readxl` and `ggplot2`) if they are not already installed.
