prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the expression data from file
expression_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Count the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(expression_data)

# Count the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(expression_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column with gene names

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
Note: Make sure that the file "leukemiaExp.txt" is in the correct directory or provide the full file path if it is in a different location.
