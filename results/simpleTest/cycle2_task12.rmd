prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
```
# Load necessary packages
library(readxl)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get number of rows and columns in count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_columns <- ncol(count_table)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get number of rows and columns in annotation data
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_columns <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns for the count table and annotation data
print(paste("Count table has", count_rows, "rows and", count_columns, "columns."))
print(paste("Annotation data has", annotation_rows, "rows and", annotation_columns, "columns."))
```
