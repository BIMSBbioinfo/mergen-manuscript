prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from "leukemiaExp.txt"
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples)
```
The output will be:
```
Number of genes: <number of genes>
Number of samples: <number of samples>
```
