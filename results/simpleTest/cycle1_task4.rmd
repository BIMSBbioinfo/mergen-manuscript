prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment,"SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2  # Assuming the first and last columns are gene names and lengths, respectively

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
Note: Replace "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" with the actual filename/path of the count table file.
