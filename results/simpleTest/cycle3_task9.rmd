prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

```
# Load required libraries

library(RColorBrewer)
library(factoextra)

# Read the gene expression data file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Remove the first column (gene names)
data <- data[, -1]

# Filter genes based on their variability
var_genes <- apply(data, 1, var)
top_var_genes <- names(sort(var_genes, decreasing = TRUE))[1:1000]

# Subset data using the top variable genes
filtered_data <- data[top_var_genes, ]

# Perform hierarchical clustering and plot the heatmap
heatmap_data <- as.matrix(filtered_data)
heatmap_colors <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9,"Blues"))(100)
heatmap(heatmap_data, col = heatmap_colors, scale = "none", main = "Heatmap of Top 1000 Variable Genes", xlab = "Sample")

# Perform PCA analysis and plot the PCA biplot
pca_data <- prcomp(filtered_data, scale = TRUE)
pca_biplot <- fviz_pca_biplot(pca_data, col.ind = "contrib", label = "var", geom.ind = "point", repel = TRUE)
print(pca_biplot)
```
Note: Make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the correct file path to your gene expression data.
