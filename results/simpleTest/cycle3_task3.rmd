prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Load required library
library(openxlsx)

# Read the excel file
data <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
Note: Make sure to install the "openxlsx" package before running the code by using the command `install.packages("openxlsx")`.
