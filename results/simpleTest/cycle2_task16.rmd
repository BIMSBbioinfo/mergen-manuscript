prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
```
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Rename the first column of annotation data as "sample_id"
colnames(annotation_data)[1] <- "sample_id"

# Set the row names of count table as the gene names
rownames(count_table) <- count_table[, 1]

# Merge annotation data and count table based on the sample_id
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by = "sample_id", all.x = TRUE)

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample
boxplot(as.matrix(merged_data[, 3:ncol(merged_data)]), 
        col = annotation_data$group,
        main = "Gene Expression Boxplots per Sample",
        xlab = "Sample",
        ylab = "Gene Expression Value")

```
Note: Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths and names in your system.
