prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
```
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Read the count table 
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merge the count table and annotation data
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = "row.names", all.x = TRUE)

# Remove the row.names column and assign meaningful column names
colnames(merged_data)[1] <- "Gene"
merged_data <- merged_data %>% select(-Row.names)

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = Group, y = Gene)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "gray", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Sample", y = "Gene Expression") +
  theme_bw()
```
