prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment,"SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes by counting the number of rows in the count table
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Subtract 2 from the column count to exclude the first and last columns (gene names and gene length)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```
```
