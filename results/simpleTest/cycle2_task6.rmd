prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the data from the file
data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t")

# Check the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Check if there are more than 500 samples
if(num_samples > 500) {
  # Randomly sample 500 samples
  set.seed(123)  # Set a seed for reproducibility
  sampled_data <- data[, sample(num_samples, size = 500)]
} else {
  sampled_data <- data  # If there are less or equal to 500 samples, keep the original data
}

# Print the subsetted data
print(sampled_data)
```
Note: Make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file path of your data.
