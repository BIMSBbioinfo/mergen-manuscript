prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
gene_expr <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expr)

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expr)

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```
