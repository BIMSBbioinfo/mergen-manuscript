prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of rows and columns for count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_columns <- ncol(count_table)

# Count the number of rows and columns for annotation data
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_columns <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the results
print(paste("Count table has", count_rows, "rows and", count_columns, "columns."))
print(paste("Annotation data has", annotation_rows, "rows and", annotation_columns, "columns."))
```
Note: Make sure to have the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" files in your working directory before running the code.
