prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapId.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

```
# Read the datasets
met_df <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
subjects_df <- read.table("subjects.txt", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Get the list of DBGap IDs for individuals
dbgap_ids <- subjects_df$dbGap_ID

# Filter the met_df to include only the CpGs associated with Age
age_cpgs <- met_df[, c("CpG_id", dbgap_ids)]
age_cpgs <- age_cpgs[rowSums(age_cpgs[, -1]) > 0, ]  # Remove rows with all 0 values

# Filter the age_cpgs to exclude CpGs associated with sex or Race
age_cpgs <- age_cpgs[!grepl("sex|Race", colnames(age_cpgs))]

# Sort the CpGs by their sum of methylation values and get the top 20
top_20_cpgs <- head(age_cpgs[order(rowSums(age_cpgs[, -1]), decreasing=TRUE), ], 20)

# Display the top 20 CpGs
print(top_20_cpgs)
```
Note: This code assumes that the CpG methylation values are numeric and that the first column in the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file is labeled "CpG_id". If this is not the case, please update the code accordingly.
