prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Count number of rows and columns in the count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Count number of rows and columns in the annotation data
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the results
count_rows
count_cols
annotation_rows
annotation_cols
```
```
