prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapId.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

```
# Read the CpG methylation values table
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Read the subjects information table
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Get the matching individuals between the two datasets
matching_individuals <- intersect(metRmOl[1, ], subjects$dbGap_ID)

# Get the index of the matching individuals in the CpG methylation values table
matching_individuals_index <- match(matching_individuals, metRmOl[1, ])

# Filter the CpG methylation values table to include only the matching individuals
filtered_metRmOl <- metRmOl[, matching_individuals_index]

# Get the index of the "Age" column in the subjects information table
age_column_index <- which(names(subjects) == "Age")

# Get the index of the "sex" column in the subjects information table
sex_column_index <- which(names(subjects) == "sex")

# Get the index of the "Race" column in the subjects information table
race_column_index <- which(names(subjects) == "Race")

# Get the index of the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
age_cpgs_index <- which(subjects$Age != "" & subjects$sex == "" & subjects$Race == "")

# Get the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
age_cpgs <- rownames(filtered_metRmOl)[age_cpgs_index]

# Display the top 20 CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
top_20_age_cpgs <- head(age_cpgs, 20)
