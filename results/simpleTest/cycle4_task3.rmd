prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Load the necessary library
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column (gene names)

# Print the number of genes and samples
num_genes
num_samples
```
