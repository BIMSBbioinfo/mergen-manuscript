prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Read the data and merge them into a single table using dbGapId information. Plot a scatter plot of CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects in the samples.

```
# Load the necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Match the dbGap ID column in subject_data to the first row of met_data
matching_id <- subject_data$dbGapID[match(colnames(met_data)[-1], subject_data$dbGapID)]

# Add the Age column from subject_data to met_data based on matching_id
met_data$Age <- subject_data$Age[match(colnames(met_data)[-1], matching_id)]

# Filter out the two oldest subjects
oldest_data <- met_data[order(met_data$Age, decreasing = TRUE), ]
oldest_data <- oldest_data[1:2, ]

# Create a scatter plot of CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects
ggplot(oldest_data, aes(x = `CpG_id`, y = `DBGapId`)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "CpG Methylation Values for the Two Oldest Subjects",
       x = "CpG ID", y = "DBGap ID")
