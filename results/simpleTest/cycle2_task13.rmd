prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Merge annotation data and count table by matching sample ids
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "Sample_ID", by.y = "Sample_ID", all.y = TRUE)

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```

Please note that you need to have the `readxl` package installed in order to read the Excel file.
