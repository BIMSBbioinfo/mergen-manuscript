prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
library(pheatmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggfortify)

# Load the gene expression data
exp_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Calculate the variance of each gene
gene_var <- apply(exp_data, 1, var)

# Sort genes by variance in descending order
sorted_genes <- names(sort(gene_var, decreasing = TRUE))

# Select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_1000_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000]

# Subset the expression data to include only the top 1000 genes
filtered_exp_data <- exp_data[top_1000_genes, ]

# Plot a heatmap with clustering
pheatmap(filtered_exp_data, cluster_rows = TRUE, cluster_cols = TRUE)

# Perform principal component analysis (PCA)
pca <- prcomp(filtered_exp_data)

# Plot PCA for samples
autoplot(pca)
```
```
Note: Please make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file name and path if different from the current working directory.
