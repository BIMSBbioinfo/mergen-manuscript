prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Check the number of columns/samples
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Check if there are more than 500 samples
if (num_samples > 500) {
  # Randomly sample 500 samples
  sampled_data <- data[, sample(2:num_samples, 500)]
} else {
  sampled_data <- data
}

# Print the subset of data
print(sampled_data)
```
Note: Replace "leukemiaExp.txt" in the code with the actual file path and name of your gene expression data file.
