prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
# Load required libraries
library(gplots)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(ape)

# Read the gene expression data
gene_exp <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Transpose the data
gene_exp <- t(gene_exp)

# Calculate the variance for each gene
gene_variances <- apply(gene_exp, 1, var)

# Sort genes based on variance in descending order and select top 1000 genes
top_var_genes <- gene_exp[order(gene_variances, decreasing = TRUE)[1:1000],]

# Plot heatmap with clustering
heatmap.2(as.matrix(top_var_genes), scale = "row", trace = "none", dendrogram = "both",
          col = colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9, "Blues"))(255))

# Perform PCA on the samples
pca <- prcomp(top_var_genes, scale = TRUE)

# Plot PCA
plot(pca$x, col = c(rep("red", 23), rep("blue", 11)), pch = 16)

# Add labels for samples
text(pca$x, labels = colnames(top_var_genes), pos = 4)
```
Note: Please make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the correct file path for your gene expression data.
