prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes cluster the samples, and extract cluster specific genes for each cluster.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Calculate the variance of each gene
variances <- apply(data[, -1], 1, var)

# Sort the genes based on their variance in descending order
sorted_genes <- data[order(variances, decreasing = TRUE), ]

# Filter the top 1000 most variable genes
filtered_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000, ]

# Transpose the filtered genes data frame
transposed_genes <- t(filtered_genes[, -1])

# Cluster the samples using hierarchical clustering
clusters <- hclust(dist(transposed_genes))
cluster_membership <- cutree(clusters, k = 5)  # Assuming 5 clusters, you can change this value

# Extract cluster specific genes for each cluster
cluster_specific_genes <- lapply(1:max(cluster_membership), function(cluster) {
  specific_genes <- rownames(filtered_genes)[cluster_membership == cluster]
  return(specific_genes)
})

# Print the cluster specific genes for each cluster
for (i in 1:length(cluster_specific_genes)) {
  cat("Cluster", i, "specific genes:\n")
  cat(cluster_specific_genes[[i]], "\n\n")
}
```
