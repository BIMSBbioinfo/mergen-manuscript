prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Build a predictive model to predict Age from methylation values, and display most important variables for the predictive models.

# Load necessary libraries

# Read in the methylation data
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Transpose the methylation data so that individuals are in rows and CpGs are in columns
methylation_data <- t(methylation_data)

# Set the row names of the methylation data to the DBGap IDs
row.names(methylation_data) <- methylation_data[1, ]
methylation_data <- methylation_data[-1, ]

# Read in the subjects data
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Match the DBGap IDs in the subjects data to the columns in the methylation data
matched_data <- methylation_data[, colnames(methylation_data) %in% subjects_data$dbGap.ID]

# Merge the matched data with the age column from the subjects data
merged_data <- merge(matched_data, subjects_data[, c("dbGap.ID", "Age")], by.x = 0, by.y = "dbGap.ID", all.x = TRUE)

# Remove NA rows
merged_data <- merged_data[complete.cases(merged_data), ]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(merged_data$Age, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
trainData <- merged_data[trainIndex, ]
testData <- merged_data[-trainIndex, ]

# Train the predictive model
model <- train(Age ~ ., data = trainData[, -1], method = "glm")

# Display the most important variables for the predictive model
varImp(model)
```

Note: This code assumes that the columns in the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file and the "subjects.txt" file are in the same order and that the DBGap IDs in the "subjects.txt" file match the column names in the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file.
