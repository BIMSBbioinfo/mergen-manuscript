prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Build a predictive model to predict Age from methylation values, and display most important variables for the predictive models. 

response:
```
# Read the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Match the individuals based on DBGap ID
matched_data <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "DBGapId", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Split the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(1)
train_index <- sample(nrow(matched_data), nrow(matched_data)*0.7)
train_data <- matched_data[train_index, ]
test_data <- matched_data[-train_index, ]

# Build a predictive model using linear regression
model <- lm(Age ~ ., data = train_data)

# Display the most important variables for the predictive model
summary(model)

# Make predictions on the test data
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_data)

# Measure the accuracy of the model
accuracy <- cor(test_data$Age, predictions)
accuracy
```
Note: This code assumes that the datasets are in the working directory and that they are in the specified formats. Make sure to adjust the file paths if necessary.
