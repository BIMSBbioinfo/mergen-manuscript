prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	34	63	M	CAUC


response:
To complete this task, we first use the `read.table` function to read the "subjects.txt" file. Using the argument `sep = "\t"` specifies that the file is tab-separated. 

The `dim` function is then used to find the number of rows and columns in the data. `dim` returns a vector where the first element is the number of rows and the second is the number of columns. 

Here is the R code:

```
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
cat("Number of rows: ", nrow(subjects_data), "\n")
cat("Number of columns: ", ncol(subjects_data), "\n")
```

In this code, `nrow(subjects_data)` will return the number of rows and `ncol(subjects_data)` will return the number of columns.
