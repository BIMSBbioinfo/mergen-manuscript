prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	patient34	63	M	CAUC


response:
To complete this task, you can use the "read.table()" function to import the "subjects.txt" file as a data frame in R. Afterward, we can use the "dim()" function to retrieve the number of rows and columns. Here is the R code to achieve this:

```
data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_columns <- ncol(data)
print(paste("Number of rows: ", num_rows))
print(paste("Number of columns: ", num_columns))
```

This code reads the "subjects.txt" file into a data frame (making sure to treat the first line as column names with the "header = TRUE" argument). It then uses the "nrow()" and "ncol()" functions to retrieve the number of rows and columns, respectively, in the data frame. The "print()" and "paste()" functions are then used to print out the numbers of rows and columns.
