prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
In R, we will use the read.table function to read the file. Then, we use built-in functions to get the number of genes and samples in the list. Note that in this example we assume the file "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" is located in your current working directory. If the file is located elsewhere, you have to provide the path to the file.

```
# Read the table
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes (number of rows - 1 because of the header row, and -1 more because there's an extra column for gene lengths)
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Get the number of samples (number of columns - 2, accounting for the gene names and width columns)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

num_genes
num_samples
```
