prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
It appears the error was caused because there's only one group in your annotation data. When ggplot2 tries to create a separate color for each level of the factor in the 'group' column, it fails because there's only one level to work with. So, let's add a check to see if there's only one group, in that case we won't include a fill aesthetic that tries to apply different colors to different groups.

Please see the revised code below:

```
# load the necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

# read the gene expression data
gene_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# read the annotation data
annot_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# reshape the data to a long format
long_gene_data <- gene_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -Genes, names_to = "diagnosis", values_to = "Expression")

# merge the two datasets based on the common column "diagnosis"
merged_data <- left_join(long_gene_data, annot_data, by = "diagnosis")

# generate boxplot
n_groups <- length(unique(merged_data$group))

if(n_groups > 1) {
    p <- ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = diagnosis, y = Expression, fill = group)) +
       geom_boxplot() +
       theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
} else {
    p <- ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = diagnosis, y = Expression)) +
       geom_boxplot() +
       theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
}

print(p)
```
This code checks the number of unique groups in the merged data, if there's more than one group it colors the boxplots based on group. Otherwise, it produces a boxplot without color-coding.
