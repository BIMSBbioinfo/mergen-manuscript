prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I see. My apologies for the confusion. It seems there might be a mismatch in column names used for merging annotation and gene expression data. The code below takes into account that the first column in the annotation data is named `diagnosis`, and that the column for sample names in the transposed gene expression data is named `sample`.

```
# Load libraries
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Read in data
gene_expression <- read_xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Transpose the gene expression data (excluding the first column i.e. Gene names)
gene_expression_t <- t(gene_expression[,-1])

# Convert the transposed data to a data frame and name the columns as the Gene names
gene_expression_transposed <- as.data.frame(gene_expression_t, 
                                            row.names = 1, 
                                            col.names = gene_expression[[1]])

# Add "sample" as a column in gene_expression df based on its row names
gene_expression_transposed$sample <- rownames(gene_expression_transposed)

# Convert "sample" column to a character (not factor) to avoid issues with join operation
gene_expression_transposed$sample <- as.character(gene_expression_transposed$sample)

# Similarly, convert the 'diagnosis' column of annotation data to character
annotation$diagnosis <- as.character(annotation$diagnosis)

# Merge data
merged_data <- left_join(annotation, gene_expression_transposed, by = c("diagnosis" = "sample"))

# Now, you can plot box plots for each sample based on their 'group' variable.

ggplot(gather(merged_data, Gene, Expression, -diagnosis, -group, -LibrarySelection),
       aes(x = diagnosis, y = Expression, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + 
  ylab("Gene Expression") +
  xlab("Samples")
```

Specifically, this code now transforms data as before but uses the correct column names based on your annotation file. It then joins the two data sets based on these columns and plots the resulting merged data.
