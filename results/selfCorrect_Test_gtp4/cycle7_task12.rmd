prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I apologize for the error. The error message suggests that there are duplicate gene names in your data, which is not allowed in the row names of a data frame.

The solution is to first check for duplicates before setting row names and then handle them accordingly. In this case, I will add suffixes to duplicate row names.

```
# Ensure the necessary packages are installed and then load them
if (!require(readxl)) {
  
}
if (!require(readr)) {
  
}

# Load the packages into the R environment
library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Read the data from the Excel file
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Handle duplicates in gene names by adding a numbered suffix
duplicated_genes <- duplicated(count_table$Genes)
if(any(duplicated_genes)) {
  count_table$Genes[duplicated_genes] <- paste0(count_table$Genes[duplicated_genes], "_", 1:sum(duplicated_genes))
}

# Convert the data.frame column to a vector and assign to row names
rownames(count_table) <- count_table$Genes

# Remove first column now that it's set as row names
count_table$Genes <- NULL

# Read the data from the TSV file
sample_annotation <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Print the number of rows and columns in count_table and sample_annotation 
cat("Count table has", nrow(count_table), "rows and", ncol(count_table), "columns\n")
cat("Sample annotation has", nrow(sample_annotation), "rows and", ncol(sample_annotation), "columns\n")
```
This revised code will first check and handle any duplicated gene names before setting the row names, thereby avoiding errors related to duplicate row names.
