prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
To read an Excel file in R, you can use the readxl package. First, you need to install it if you haven't done this before, using the command ``. 

Here is the R code to read the data and get the number of genes and samples:

```
# Load necessary library
library(readxl)

# Load data
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to not count the gene names column

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of genes: ", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples: ", num_samples))
```

In this code, `read_excel` function is used to read the Excel data, `nrow` function is used to get the number of rows (i.e., genes), and `ncol` function is used to get the number of columns (i.e., samples) in the data. The 1 is subtracted from the number of columns (using `- 1`) to exclude the column for the gene names. The final result is printed once the code is run.
