prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21

```
# You need to install the readxl package if you haven't installed it. 
# Use the following command to install 
# 

# Once done, load the package
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Number of genes can be obtained by subtracting 1 from the number of rows (excluding header)
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1

# Number of samples can be obtained by subtracting 1 from the number of columns (excluding gene names)
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of genes: ", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples: ", num_samples))
```
This code will read your excel file into the R data frame and calculate the number of genes and samples from it. Remember to replace the file path in read_excel() with your actual file path if your file is located elsewhere.
