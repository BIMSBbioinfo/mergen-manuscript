prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
The "error: more columns than column names" error means that your files might contain more columns than what's specified in the file headers. This error usually occurs if the data file is not formatted correctly or if there is a mismatch between the data and their header. To resolve this error, you need to open your data and manually inspect it for irregularities, such as extra columns or typo in the header.

However, as we don't have access to your actual data files, here is the example from previously provided data snippets to demonstrate the process:

```
library(DESeq2)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)

# load count data
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
rownames(data) <- data$Genes
data$Genes <- NULL

# Make a copy of data to avoid changes in original data
newdata <- data

# If there are more column than column names,
# add anonymous names to unnamed columns
if(ncol(newdata) > length(names(newdata))) {
  missing <- ncol(newdata) - length(names(newdata))
  names(newdata) <- c(names(newdata), paste0("V", seq_along(missing)))
}

# load annotation data 
annotation <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)
rownames(annotation) <- annotation$LibrarySelection
colData <- DataFrame(annotation)

# construct DESeqDataSet
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = newdata, colData = colData, design = ~ group)

# perform differential expression analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# find genes specific for each "group"
resList <- lapply(unique(colData$group), function(gene) results(dds, contrast=c("group", gene)))

rld <- rlog(dds)
data <- assay(rld)

# Extract group specific genes
sigGenes <- unique(unlist(lapply(resList, function(x) rownames(x[which(x$padj < 0.1), ]))))

# Subset the data to include only group specific genes
data_subset <- data[sigGenes, ]

# Perform PCA
pca <- prcomp(t(data_subset))

# Prepare data for ggplot2
df <- data.frame(pca$x)
df$group <- colData$group

# Generate PCA plot
ggplot(df, aes(PC1, PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_classic()
```
Please make sure to check your data files for any irregularities that could lead to errors. I recommend visually inspecting your data file to ensure there's no unexpected elements that may cause this error.
