prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I apologize for the confusion. The issue seems to be with duplicated gene names. Rows in a data frame in R must have unique names. Here, I'll add check for duplicated gene names and if duplicated gene names exist, a suffix will be added to make all gene names unique.

Here is the corrected code:

```
# Load necessary libraries
library("DESeq2")
library("readxl")
library("tidyverse")

# Read the data
count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
col_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Check for duplicate gene names and make all gene names unique
if (any(duplicated(count_data$Genes))) {
  count_data$Genes <- make.unique(as.character(count_data$Genes))
}

# Set rownames to gene names and remove 'Genes' column
rownames(count_data) <- count_data$Genes
count_data$Genes <- NULL

# Convert count data to DESeqDataSet
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_data,
                              colData = col_data,
                              design = ~ group)

# Perform differential expression analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Get differentially expressed genes
res <- results(dds)

# Get significantly differentially expressed genes
sig_genes <- subset(res, padj < 0.05)
sig_genes <- rownames(sig_genes)

# Subset the count data with significant genes only
count_data_sig <- count_data[sig_genes, ]

# Run PCA on the transposed dataset
pca <- prcomp(t(count_data_sig))

# Get a dataframe for plotting
df <- data.frame(pca$x, diagnosis = col_data$diagnosis)

# Make the plot
ggplot(df, aes(PC1, PC2, color = diagnosis)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot", x = "PC1", y = "PC2")
```

This code checks for duplicate gene names, and if there are any, it makes them unique by adding a suffix. It then sets the rownames of the count_data dataframe to this gene list and removes the 'Genes' column. It runs PCA only on the significant genes and plots them colored by the 'diagnosis' variable from your annotation data.
