prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
Here is R code that loads the table from the tsv file using read.table function. Then simply use the ncol() and nrow() functions to get number of samples (columns) and genes (rows) respectively.

```
# Load the data
data <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 2  # Subtract 2 to exclude gene name and gene length columns

# Number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# Print the results
print(paste("The dataset has", num_samples, "samples and", num_genes, "genes."))
```
This code assumes that the file 'SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv' is located in the current working directory. If the file is located in a different directory, you should modify the file path accordingly.
