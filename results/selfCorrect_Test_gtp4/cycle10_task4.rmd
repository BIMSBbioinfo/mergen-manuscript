prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
You can read this file into R using `read.table` or `read.csv`. Since it's tab-separated, you would use `\t` as the separator. File is read into a `data.frame`, and you can get the number of genes using the `nrow` function and the number of samples by substracting 2 from the number of columns (using `ncol`).

Here is the R code:

```
# Read the file
data <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 2  # Subtracting gene names and length columns

print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```
This code assumes that the file is in your working directory. If not, replace `"SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv"` with the full path to the file.
