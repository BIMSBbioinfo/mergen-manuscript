prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
You can use the "readxl" R package to read your data from the Excel file. To get the number of genes and samples, we will use the dim() function, which will return the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in your data. As first column is gene names, number of samples would be number of columns - 1.

Here's the R code:

```
# Install the package if you haven't installed it before
# 

# Load the required package
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file data
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- dim(data)[1]

# Get the number of samples (subtract 1 for the Genes column)
num_samples <- dim(data)[2] - 1

print(paste("Number of genes : ", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples : ", num_samples))
```

Please replace the file name and its path in the read_excel() function if the Excel file is not in your current working directory. The code will print the number of genes and samples in your data set.
Note: as the content of Excel file is not provided, the code uses the filename directly. There might be necessary adjustments such as sheet name if there are multiple sheets, or skip if there are headers or additional rows.
