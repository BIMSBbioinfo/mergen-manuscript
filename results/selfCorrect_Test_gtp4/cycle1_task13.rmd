prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
You can use the following R code to accomplish this:

```
# load necessary packages


library(readxl)
library(readr)

# load the gene expression data
gene_counts <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", col_names = TRUE)

# load the annotation data 
annotation <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", "\t", col_names = TRUE)

# merging the two data frames 
gene_counts <- merge(gene_counts, annotation, by.x="Genes", by.y="diagnosis", all.x=TRUE)

# calculate the number of columns
num_cols <- ncol(gene_counts)

num_cols
```

Please note that this code assumes that the first column of your `gene_counts` data frame is named "Genes" and the first column of your `annotation` data frame is named "diagnosis". If the column names are different, you'll need to modify the `by.x` and `by.y` arguments in the `merge()` function. This code also assumes that the files "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" are located in your current working directory. If they are located elsewhere, you'll need to specify the absolute path to the files.
