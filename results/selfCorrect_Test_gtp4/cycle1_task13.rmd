prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Apologies for the confusion. It seems that the issue is with the `rownames()` function used with `t()`. By removing the row names in the expression data before the transpose, the duplicate row names problem will be fixed.

Use a strategy to create an additional column in the expression data to hold the gene names instead of storing them in the row names. Here is the revised code:

```
# load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# load the gene expression data
exp_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# transpose the data and convert to data frame
exp_data_transpose <- as.data.frame(t(exp_data[-1]), row.names = NULL)
names(exp_data_transpose) <- c("diagnosis", as.character(exp_data$Genes))

# load the annotation data
ann_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# merge datasets based on sample names
merged_data <- merge(ann_data, exp_data_transpose, by = "diagnosis")

# print the number of columns in the merged data frame
cat("The number of columns is: ", ncol(merged_data))
```

This modified code should avoid errors related to duplicate row names. The transpose operation (`t`) does not preserve the row names, therefore an additional diagnosis column is created to hold this data.
