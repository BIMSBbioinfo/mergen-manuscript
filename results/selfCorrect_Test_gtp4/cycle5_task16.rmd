prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Apologies for the confusion earlier. This issue is typically due to duplicate column names, or duplicate values in the identifier variable being used for joining the two data frames (in the `left_join` function).

Given that we're merging on the basis of sample IDs, let's first confirm that they're unique in the annotation file ("SRP021193.colData.tsv"), and then we can proceed with the merging and plotting.

Here's the revised code:

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Read .xlsx file
data_exp <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read .tsv file
data_anno <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Validate that the sample IDs in annotation file are unique
if(length(unique(data_anno$LibrarySelection)) != nrow(data_anno)) {
  stop("LibrarySelection variable in the annotation file contains duplicate values. It should be unique for merging.")
}

# Transpose data_exp so that it matches the format of data_anno for merging
data_exp_transposed <- data_exp %>% 
  pivot_longer(-Genes, names_to = "LibrarySelection", values_to = "Expression")

# Merge data
data_merged <- left_join(data_anno, data_exp_transposed, by = "LibrarySelection")

# Create boxplot
ggplot(data_merged, aes(x = LibrarySelection, y = Expression, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

Please provide the full path to your file if they're not in the current working directory. And make sure that the column names in your files match with those used in the code. For instance, I expect "`Genes`", "`LibrarySelection`", and "`group`" to be present in your files. If they're named differently, please update the code accordingly.
