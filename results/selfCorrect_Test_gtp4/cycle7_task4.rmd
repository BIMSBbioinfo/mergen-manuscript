prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
You can use the read.delim to read the tab separated file and then use the dim function to get the dimensions of the dataframe.

```
# Read the data
data <- read.delim("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Number of samples is the number of columns minus 2 (one for gene names and one for gene length)
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 2

# Number of genes is the number of rows
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# Print the numbers
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
```

The above script will print how many genes and samples the data set have assuming that the first column contains the gene names and the last column is gene length.
