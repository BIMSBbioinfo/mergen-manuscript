prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
You can use the `read.table` function to load the dataset into R and then use the `ncol` and `nrow` functions to determine the number of samples (columns) and genes (rows).

```
# load data
data <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE)
# calculate number of samples, not including the first and last column (gene names and length)
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 2
# calculate number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(data)

print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
```

This code outputs the number of genes and samples in the dataset. Note that for the `ncol` function, we subtract 2 because the first column (gene names) and the last column (gene length) are not samples.
