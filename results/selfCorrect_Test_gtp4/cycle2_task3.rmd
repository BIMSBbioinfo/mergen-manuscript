prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
You can use the `readxl` package to read excel files. After loading the data, you can use functions like `nrow` and `ncol` to get the number of genes (which are number of rows) and the number of samples (which are number of columns minus 1, because the first column contains gene names, not sample data).

```
# Install and load readxl package
if(!require(readxl)) {
   
  library(readxl)
}

# Load data
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data)
# Subtracting 1 because first column contains gene names
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1

# print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of Genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of Samples:", num_samples))
```

Please replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with your local file path to the file. Also, please ensure that the file is in the working directory of your R session for the code to work properly.
