prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
To count the number of genes and samples in the dataset, you can use the readxl package in R which allows to read Excel files and here is the code for that.

```
# Load required package

library(readxl)

library(dplyr)

# Import data from excel file
gene_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns)
num_genes <- nrow(gene_data) - 1  # subtracting 1 to exclude the header
num_samples <- ncol(gene_data) - 1  # subtracting 1 to exclude the "Genes" column

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes: ", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples: ", num_samples))
```

This piece of code first loads the needed package, then imports the data from the excel file. After this, the number of genes and samples are calculated by counting the number of rows and columns in the data respectively. 

Please note that you need to install and load the readxl and dplyr packages in R for this code to work. Also, the working directory of R should be set to the directory where the Excel file is located.
