prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	patient34	63	M	CAUC


response:
To read a tab separated file, you can use the `read.delim()` function in R which is specifically designed to read tab delimited files. Secondly, the `dim()` function in R gives the dimension (number of rows and columns) of a matrix, data frame or array.

Here is the R code to perform this task:

```
# Reading the file
data <- read.delim("subjects.txt")

# Printing the number of rows and columns
print(dim(data))
```
This code will output a two-element vector representing the number of rows and columns in the data set.
