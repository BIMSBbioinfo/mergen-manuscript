prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
The following R code reads in the ".tsv" file, then determines the number of genes and samples by analyzing the dimensions of the resulting data frame.

```
# Read in the data
count_table <- read.delim("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header=T)

# Find out how many genes and samples there are
num_genes <- nrow(count_table) # Number of rows (minus header) is number of genes
num_samples <- ncol(count_table)-2 # Number of columns (minus gene names and gene length columns) is number of samples

num_genes
num_samples
```

The 'read.delim' function is used to read in tab-delimited files. The 'nrow' function returns the number of rows in the data frame, and the 'ncol' function returns the number of columns. Since the first column is the gene names and the last column is gene length, these are subtracted to find the number of samples.
