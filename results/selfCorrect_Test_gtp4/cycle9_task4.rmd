prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
You can use the `read.table` function to read the TSV file into R and then use the `dim` function to find out the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns). 

```
# Read the TSV file into R
data <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Find the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- dim(data)[1]

# The number of samples is the number of columns minus 2 (one for the gene names and one for the gene length)
num_samples <- dim(data)[2] - 2

num_genes
num_samples
```
This will give you the number of genes and samples in the dataset. The `dim` function gives the dimensions of a data frame in R (first the number of rows and then the number of columns).
