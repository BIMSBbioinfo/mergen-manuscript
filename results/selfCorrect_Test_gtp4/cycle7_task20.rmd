prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I apologize for that. It seems some of your gene names are duplicated. The issue is that rownames in R must be unique. Here, we will use the make.names function to assure that rownames are unique.

```
# Required Libraries
library(readxl)    # Import .xlsx file
library(DESeq2)    # Differential gene expression
library(ggplot2)   # Plotting

# Import matrices
count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
rownames(count_data) <- make.names(count_data$Genes, unique = TRUE)
count_data$Genes <- NULL
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Create DESeq object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_data, colData = annotation_data, design= ~ group)

# Run DESeq function
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Retrieve the result
res <- results(dds)

# Extract significant DE genes
sig_genes <- res[which(res$padj < 0.05), ]

# Subset original count data by these specific genes
new_count_data <- count_data[rownames(count_data) %in% rownames(sig_genes), ]

# Perform rlog transformation
rld <- rlog(dds, blind = FALSE)

# PCA
plotPCA(rld, intgroup = "group")
```

In this code, `make.names(count_data$Genes, unique = TRUE)` will make sure the gene names are unique by appending '.#'' to the end of duplicate names where '#' is an incremental number.
