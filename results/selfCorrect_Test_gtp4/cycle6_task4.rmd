prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
Here is the R code that can be used to answer the question:

```
# Read the data file
file_data <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Determine number of genes, which is the number of rows, subtracting 1 for the header 
num_genes <- nrow(file_data)

# Determine the number of samples, which is the number of columns, subtracting 2 for the gene names and gene length columns
num_samples <- ncol(file_data) - 2

print(paste("Number of genes: ", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples: ", num_samples))
```
This code reads in the provided file, then uses the `nrow()` function to count the number of rows (genes) and the `ncol()` function to count the number of columns (samples). The last two parameters being subtracted are to exclude the gene names and gene length columns from the final sample count.
