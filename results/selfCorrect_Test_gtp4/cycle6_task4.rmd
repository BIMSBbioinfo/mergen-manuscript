prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
You can use the following R code to read in the file and check its structure. You can get the number of genes and samples by inspecting the dimension of the dataframe.

In the script below, we assume the file is located in the current working directory. If it's not the case, you should change this to the correct path.

```
# read in the file
data = read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# print the dimension of the data frame
print(dim(data))

# calculate the number of genes
num_genes = dim(data)[1] 
print(paste("Number of genes: ", num_genes))

# calculate the number of samples
num_samples = dim(data)[2] - 2  # subtract 2 for the gene names column and the gene length column
print(paste("Number of samples: ", num_samples))
```

In this script we read in the file "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" with the 'read.table' function. We then determine the dimension of the data frame 'data' with the 'dim' function which returns the number of rows and columns. The number of genes corresponds to the number of rows, while the number of samples corresponds to the number of columns minus 2 (because there are columns for the gene names and gene length).
