prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	patient34	63	M	CAUC


response:
Sure, the R code to read in the file and determine the number of rows and columns would look like this:

```
# Read in the 'subjects.txt' file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Get the number of rows in the table
num_rows <- nrow(subjects)

# Get the number of columns in the table
num_cols <- ncol(subjects)

# Print out number of rows and columns 
print(paste("Number of rows: ", num_rows))
print(paste("Number of columns: ", num_cols))
```
