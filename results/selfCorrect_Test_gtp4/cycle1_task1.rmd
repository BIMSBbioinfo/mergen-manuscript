prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	34	63	M	CAUC


response:
The R language provides numerous functions to read and explore datasets. Here is the code to read a tab separated file and find out the number of rows and columns it has.

```
# Reading the file 
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Finding the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(subjects)
num_cols <- ncol(subjects)

# Printing the number of rows and columns
cat("The number of rows is: ", num_rows, "\n")
cat("The number of columns is: ", num_cols, "\n")
```

In this code, `read.table` function is used to read the file. The `header = TRUE` argument specifies that the first row of the file represents the variable names. The `sep = "\t"` argument specifies that the file is tab separated. Then `nrow` and `ncol` functions are used to find the number of rows and columns respectively.
