prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I apologize for the mistake earlier. It seems that I misunderstood the structure of the data. The transcription of the gene table was unnecessary, as CASE_* and CTRL_* must be corresponding to sample IDs. Therefore, the correct solution would just involve a merge operation of the two tables directly.

Please use the following code to merge data frames:

```
# Import libraries


library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Load Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx
Supplementary_table <- read_excel('Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx')

# Load annotation data SRP021193.colData.tsv
ann_data <- read.delim('SRP021193.colData.tsv', sep='\t', header=T, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
colnames(ann_data)[1] <- "Sample_ID"

# Change the long format to wide format
Supplementary_table_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(Supplementary_table, -Genes, names_to = "Sample_ID", values_to = "counts")

# Merge annotation data and gene expression tables
merged_data <- merge(ann_data, Supplementary_table_long, by="Sample_ID", all=TRUE)

# Count number of columns and rows in the merged data
num_cols = ncol(merged_data)
num_rows = nrow(merged_data)

print(paste0("The number of columns: ", num_cols))
print(paste0("The number of rows: ", num_rows))
```

Please note this code requires the "tidyr" package to convert the Supplementary_table from wide format to long format, so each row contains a single count for a gene in a specific sample. Then the merge function can be used to combine the annotation data and count data based on the Sample_ID.
