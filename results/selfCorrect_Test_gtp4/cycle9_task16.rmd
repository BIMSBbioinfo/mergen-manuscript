prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I apologize for the confusion. I may have made an incorrect assumption regarding the structure of your data. 

Let's modify the code to fix this issue. 
Assuming your annotation data has sample names in the first column which is not explicitly specified in your question. The warning you saw usually comes up if the column we are trying to merge doesn't exist in both data frames. 

Assuming the annotations are in the first column with no header for the samples, we can modify the merging step using the dplyr's `rename()` function. 

Let's try the revised code below:

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the gene expression data and annotation data
gene_expression <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

annotation <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = FALSE)
colnames(annotation) <- c("sample", "diagnosis", "group", "LibrarySelection")

# Convert wide format data to long format
long_data <- gather(gene_expression, sample, expression, -Genes)

# Merge the two data frames
merged_data <- full_join(long_data, annotation, by = 'sample')

# Plot gene expressions per sample, colored by their group
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = sample, y = expression, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```
Please replace the filenames with the correct paths to the files if they are not in the same directory. Also, make sure the all column names are properly written and match in both datasets, the 'sample' column, for example.
