prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	patient34	63	M	CAUC


response:
Here is your R script:

```
# Use read.delim() function from the utils package to read the tab separated file
subjects_df <- read.delim("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, check.names = FALSE)

# Print the dimensions of the dataframe
print(dim(subjects_df))
```
This script will first load the data into a data frame in R, and then print the number of rows and columns of the data frame. The output of the dim() function gives you a vector where the first element is the number of rows and the second element is the number of columns.
