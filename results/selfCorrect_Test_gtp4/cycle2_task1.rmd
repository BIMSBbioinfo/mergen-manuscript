prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	34	63	M	CAUC


response:
You can read the file using `read.table` or `read.csv` function in R and then use `dim` function to get the number of rows and columns. Here is the code.

```
# Read the file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Print number of rows and columns
nrow(subjects)
ncol(subjects)
```
Above code will first read the file named "subjects.txt" into a DataFrame named subjects. Then it prints the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame. 

The `read.table` function is used to read the file, `header = TRUE` is used because the first line of the file contains column names, and `sep = "\t"` is used because the file is tab-delimited.

The `nrow` function is used to get the number of rows and `ncol` function is used to get the number of columns in the DataFrame.
