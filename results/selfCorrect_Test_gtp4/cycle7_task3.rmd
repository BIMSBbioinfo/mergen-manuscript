prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
You can use the readxl package in R to read the excel file. Then you can use the dim() function to get the number of rows and columns which represents the number of genes and samples respectively.

Here is the R code:

```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Printing the structure of the data
# This will show the number of observations (genes) and variables (samples)
str(data)

# Alternatively, you can use the dim() function to directly get the number of genes and samples
genes <- dim(data)[1]
samples <- dim(data)[2] - 1  # Subtract 1 because the first column is gene names

print(paste0("Number of genes: ", genes))
print(paste0("Number of samples: ", samples))
```

This code reads the Excel file and retrieves the structure of the data, which by default includes the number of observations (genes) and variables (samples). The number of samples is minus one because the first column is gene names.
