prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
Here is the R code to find out the number of genes and samples in the dataset. It assumes that the data is tabulated such that each row represents a gene (excluding the first row of names) and each column represents a sample (excluding the first column of gene names).

```
# install and load packages

library(readxl)

# load data
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# get number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data) 
num_samples <- ncol(data) -1

# print results
print(paste("The dataset has", num_genes, "genes and", num_samples, "samples."))
```
This R code installs and loads the `readxl` library to import the excel data. It then uses the `nrow` function to get the number of rows in the data (representing the genes), and `ncol` function to get the number of columns (representing the samples), subtracting 1 to account for the column of gene names. The results are then printed to the console.
