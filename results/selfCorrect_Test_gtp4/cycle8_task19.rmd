prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I apologize for the confusion. The error message indicates that there may be duplicate gene names in your count data file. In dealing with RNA-seq data, it's good practice to ensure all gene names are unique. However, if this is not possible, we can append a string to duplicate gene names to make them unique. Here's the updated code:

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Import and pre-process gene counts data
count_data <- read_xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
# Append a suffix for duplicated gene names to make them unique
dup_genes <- duplicated(count_data$Genes)
if(any(dup_genes)){
  count_data$Genes[dup_genes] <- paste(count_data$Genes[dup_genes], '_dup', 1:sum(dup_genes), sep='')
}
rownames(count_data) <- count_data$Genes
count_data$Genes <- NULL  # remove the Genes column as it is now useless

# Import and pre-process annotation data
col_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
rownames(col_data) <- col_data[, 1]
col_data <- col_data[, -1]  # remove the first column as it is now useless 

# Ensure the sample names in the count data are in the same order as in the column data
count_data <- count_data[, rownames(col_data)]

# Create DESeqDataSet
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = as.matrix(count_data), colData = col_data, design = ~ group)

# Normalize counts using DESeq2
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA on the normalized counts
pca_res <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Prepare the PCA results for ggplot
pca_df <- data.frame(PC1 = pca_res$x[,1], PC2 = pca_res$x[,2])
pca_df$Sample_id <- rownames(pca_df)
pca_df <- left_join(pca_df, col_data, by = "Sample_id")

# PCA plot color-coded by "group"
ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "PCA plot color-coded by group")

# PCA plot color-coded by "LibrarySelection"
ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "PCA plot color-coded by LibrarySelection")
```

This version of the R script will alter the duplicate gene names by appending a suffix to make them unique. Please replace the argument in `design = ~ group` with your correct experimental design if it's not "group".
