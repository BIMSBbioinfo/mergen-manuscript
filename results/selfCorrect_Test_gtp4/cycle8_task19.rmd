prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Apologies for the confusion. Since the actual files and their locations are unknown, please replace 'Insert_Your_Directory_Path_Here' in the below code block with the actual path to your files on your computer. Furthermore, you may need to adjust the way the files are read in, depending on whether they're locally stored or online. 

An example of a local path could be "C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents" on windows or "/Users/YourUsername/Documents" on macOS.

Here's the R code:

```
# Load required libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Replace this with your local directory path to the Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx and SRP021193.colData.tsv files
dir_path <- "Insert_Your_Directory_Path_Here"

# Load the RNASeq counts and the sample annotations
RNASeq_counts <- read_excel(file.path(dir_path, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"))
rownames(RNASeq_counts) <- RNASeq_counts$Genes
RNASeq_counts <- RNASeq_counts[, -1]

sample_annotations <- read_tsv(file.path(dir_path, "SRP021193.colData.tsv"))
sample_annotations <- sample_annotations[row.names(RNASeq_counts), ]

# Create a DESeq2 object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = RNASeq_counts,
                              colData = sample_annotations,
                              design = ~ group)

# Normalize counts
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
norm_counts <- counts(dds, normalized=TRUE)

# Perform Principal Component Analysis
pca_result <- prcomp(t(norm_counts))

#Plot PCA, color-coded by group
df <- data.frame(pca_result$x)
df$group <- sample_annotations$group
ggplot(df, aes(PC1, PC2, color=group)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  theme_bw() 

#Plot PCA, color-coded by LibrarySelection
df$LibrarySelection <- sample_annotations$LibrarySelection
ggplot(df, aes(PC1, PC2, color=LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  theme_bw()
```
Remember to replace `"Insert_Your_Directory_Path_Here"` with your actual directory path.
