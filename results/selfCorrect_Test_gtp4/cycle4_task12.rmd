prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
You can use the `read.xlsx()` function from the `readxl` package to load the xlsx file, and `read.table()` function to load the tsv file. And then count the number of rows and columns for each dataframe using `dim()` function. Here is the R code:

```
# Loading the required libraries

library(readxl)

# Reading the Excel file
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Counting number of rows and columns 
nrow_count_table <- nrow(count_table)
ncol_count_table <- ncol(count_table)

# Reading the TSV annotation file
annotation_table <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Counting number of rows and columns 
nrow_annotation_table <- nrow(annotation_table)
ncol_annotation_table <- ncol(annotation_table)
```
Please replace the file paths with your own file paths.
