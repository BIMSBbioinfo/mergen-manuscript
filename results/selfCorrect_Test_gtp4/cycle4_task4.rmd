prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
Here's an R script that will give you the number of genes and samples in your dataset.

First of all, import the data using the `read.table()` function. This function imports the data into a data frame in R. 

Assuming that the first column is the gene and last column is the gene length, all the other columns are samples. To get the number of samples, you can subtract two from the number of columns of your data frame (one for the gene name column and one for the gene length column). To get the number of genes, simply count the number of rows in your data frame. 

Here is the R code for this:

```
# Import data
data <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count samples
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 2 

# Count genes
num_genes <- nrow(data) 

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of samples: ", num_samples))
print(paste("Number of genes: ", num_genes))
```
In this code, `ncol()` returns the number of columns in the data frame and `nrow()` returns the number of rows.
The `-2` in the calculation of `num_samples` is because we are excluding the gene names and gene length columns in the count of samples.
