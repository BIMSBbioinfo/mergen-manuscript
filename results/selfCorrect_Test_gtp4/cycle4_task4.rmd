prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
You can load your dataset using the `read.table()` function and then use the `dim()` function to check the number of genes and samples the dataset has:

```
# Load the dataset
data <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header=TRUE, sep="\t")

# Calculate the number of genes
n_genes <- dim(data)[1]

# Calculate the number of samples
n_samples <- dim(data)[2] - 2  # Subtract 2 to remove the gene names and gene length columns

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes: ", n_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples: ", n_samples))
```

With this code, the variable "n_genes" contains the number of genes, which is the number of rows in the table, and "n_samples" contains the number of samples, which is the number of columns minus 2 (because the first column with gene names and the last column with gene length are not samples).
