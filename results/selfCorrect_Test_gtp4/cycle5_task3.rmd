prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
If you want to load this Excel file into R, you will need to install and load the "readxl" package which is used to import Excel files in R. 

Below is the code to count genes and samples in the dataset:

```
# installing required package


# loading package
require(readxl) 

# reading excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# counting number of genes (subtracting 1 to exclude the header row)
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1

# counting number of samples (using first row length and subtracting 1 to exclude the gene names column)
num_samples <- length(data[1, ]) - 1

num_genes
num_samples
```
This code assumes that the excel file is located in your current working directory in R. If it's somewhere else, replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the full path to the file.
