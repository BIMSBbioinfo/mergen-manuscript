prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Apologies for the confusion earlier. Replace `'Your Path Here'` with the actual path where your 'Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx' and 'SRP021193.colData.tsv' file is stored. 

For example, If your file is located in the Documents folder, the path would be something like "C:/Users/YourName/Documents/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"
  
```
# Please replace 'Your Path Here' with the actual path to your file
my_path_to_excel = "Your Path Here/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" 
my_path_to_tsv = "Your Path Here/SRP021193.colData.tsv"

library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the gene expression data
gene_df <- readxl::read_excel(my_path_to_excel)

# Load the annotation file
annot_df <- readr::read_tsv(my_path_to_tsv)

# Transpose the gene expression data
gene_df_transposed <- gene_df %>% tidyr::pivot_longer(-Genes, names_to = "sample", values_to = "gene_expr")

# Join annotation and gene expression data
merged_df <- dplyr::inner_join(gene_df_transposed, annot_df, by = c("sample" = "diagnosis"))  

# boxplot for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots 
ggplot(merged_df, aes(x = sample, y = gene_expr, color = group)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) 
```

Replace `'Your Path Here'` with the directory path to your files. The path needs to be a character string and the forward slashes in the path are important. It should not have any spaces unless there are spaces in the folder names. Also, if you're using a Windows machine and have difficulty finding the filepath, you can shift+right-click on the file and "copy as path".
