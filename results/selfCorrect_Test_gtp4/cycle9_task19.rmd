prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I apologize for the issues and any confusion caused. The error "subscript out of bounds" typically suggests trying to access an index that does not exist in the data structure. In this case, it might be due to incorrect column name in `rownames(count_data) <- count_data[, "Genes"]`.

Let's correct it by accessing the 'Genes' column by name using double brackets `[[ ]]`.

```
# Load the required packages
library(readxl)
library(tibble)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the Excel file
count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Convert data to data frame and move 'Genes' column to rownames
count_data <- as.data.frame(count_data)
rownames(count_data) <- count_data[["Genes"]]
count_data[["Genes"]] <- NULL

# Convert data frame to matrix
count_matrix <- as.matrix(count_data)

# Make sure annotations and count data have the same samples
annotations <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
annotations <- annotations[colnames(count_matrix),]

# Make DESeq2 dataset from matrix
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_matrix,
                              colData = annotations,
                              design = ~ group)

# Run DESeq for normalization
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Extract the normalized counts
norm_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA on the transpose of the normalized counts
pca <- prcomp(t(norm_counts))

# Define group and library selection details from colData of DESeq result
groups <- colData(dds)$group
library_selection <- colData(dds)$LibrarySelection

# Create PCA plots
pca_plot_group <- ggplot(as.data.frame(pca$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = groups)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(color = "Group")

pca_plot_library_selection <- ggplot(as.data.frame(pca$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = library_selection)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(color = "Library Selection")

# Display the plots
print(pca_plot_group)
print(pca_plot_library_selection)
```

This revised script has corrected subscript out of bounds error, made sure that annotations and count data matrices have matching sample names, obtained group and library selections for color-coding the PCA plots.
