prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
The error arises because we are trying to combine character and numerical columns in a table, which is not permissible. We can see that the 'Genes' column is of character type, and the other columns in gene expression dataset appear to have numerical values representing gene counts. And trying to merge these file format is not really appropriate in the given context and there's no common column as well, it will be more efficient if we map them together using a common key such as sample ids but alas, your annotation file sample "SRP021193.colData.tsv" only contains one record which doesn't help. However, if we assume that your annotation file contains all the samples present in the expression dataset, a simpler and accurate way to process this would be as follows:

```
# Necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read in the data
exp_data <- read_xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
sample_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", "\t")

# Reshape data from wide to long format for plotting.
exp_data_long <- pivot_longer(exp_data, -Genes, names_to = "Sample", values_to = "Expression")

# Merge the reshaped gene expression data with the sample data.
full_data <- merge(exp_data_long, sample_data, by.x="Sample", by.y="diagnosis", all=TRUE)

# Boxplots of expression values per sample, colored by group.
ggplot(data = full_data, aes(x = Sample, y = Expression, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust=0.5))
```
Please replace the "Expression" with the actual name of the gene count column in the full_data. This code also assumes that your library selection is consistent with samples.
