prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Here's the R code to accomplish the tasks.

First, I load the required libraries - ggplot2 for data visualization and readxl and tidyverse for data manipulation. Then I read the input files. I'm using the `read_xlsx` function from the `readxl` package to read the excel (.xlsx) file, and `read.delim()` for the tsv file. The `merge()` function merges the annotation data and the gene expression tables.

The `gather()` function in the `tidyverse` package is used to reshape the dataframe into a tidy format for plotting. The `ggplot()` function is used to create boxplots of gene expressions.

Finally, I set a seed for replicability and use `scale_fill_brewer()` to color the boxplots based on the 'group'.

The final code is:

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the input .xlsx and .tsv files
df1 <- read_xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
df2 <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = T)

# Merge the two data frames
merged_df <- merge(df1, df2, by.x = "Genes", by.y = "diagnosis", all.x = TRUE)

# Reshape the merged data frame into a tidy format
tidy_df <- gather(merged_df, sample, expression, -Genes, -group, -LibrarySelection)

# Create boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color code by group
set.seed(1)
ggplot(tidy_df, aes(x=sample, y= expression, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = 'Boxplots of gene expression values', x = 'Sample', y = 'Expression') +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```
Please replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` in the above code with valid paths to these files on your system.
This script assumes that the TSV file uses tabs as separators and has a header. If it doesn't, please adjust the `read.delim` call accordingly.
