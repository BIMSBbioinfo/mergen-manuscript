prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
Here is the R code to determine the number of genes and the number of samples in the dataset:

```
# Load required package
library(readr)

# Read the data
data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv")

# Find the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(data) 

# Find the number of samples
# We subtract 2 because there are two columns (first and last) that do not represent samples
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 2

num_genes
num_samples

```

This code first reads the data from the tsv file into a tibble (data frame). Then, it calculates the number of rows to find the number of genes and the number of columns (subtracting 2 for the gene names and length columns) to find the number of samples. At last, it prints the number of genes and samples.
