prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
To find out how many genes and samples your RNA-seq dataset contains, you can use the following R code:

```
# Load the required library
library(readr)

# Read in the data, assuming it's in the current working directory
data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv")

# Number of genes can be found by counting the number of rows. Each row corresponds to a gene
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# Number of samples can be found by counting the number of columns aside from gene names and gene length. In this case, the gene length is the last column and gene names is the first column.
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 2

print(paste("Number of genes: ", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples: ", num_samples))
```

This code uses the `read_tsv` function from the "readr" package to read in your data. It then uses the `nrow` and `ncol` functions to count the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples). Note that we subtract 2 from the column count to exclude the columns for gene names and gene length.
