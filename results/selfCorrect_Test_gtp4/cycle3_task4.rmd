prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
You can use the read.table() function to read the file. Then, columns correspond to samples and first and last columns correspond to gene names and gene length. The number of genes and samples in the dataset can be calculated using the dim() function, which returns the number of rows and columns.

Here is the R code for it.

```
# load the file
data <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# get the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- dim(data)[1]
num_cols <- dim(data)[2]

# the number of genes is equal to the number of rows
num_genes <- num_rows 

# the number of samples is equal to the number of columns - 2 (subtract gene names and gene length)
num_samples <- num_cols - 2

print(paste("Number of genes: ", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples: ", num_samples))
```
This code first loads the .tsv file, then calculates the numbers of genes and samples, and finally, prints these numbers. Note that the path to the file used by read.table function must be changed to the actual location of your file.
