prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
You can use the following R code to count the number of genes and samples in the dataset.

```
# read the dataset into a data frame
df <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header=TRUE, sep="\t")

# count the number of genes
gene_count <- nrow(df)

# count the number of samples
# subtract by 2 because the first and last columns are not samples
sample_count <- ncol(df) - 2

print(paste("Number of genes:", gene_count))
print(paste("Number of samples:", sample_count))
```

In this code, `read.table()` is used to read the file and create a data frame. `nrow()` and `ncol()` are then used to count the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the data frame, respectively. Note that we subtract by 2 when counting samples to account for the first and last columns not being samples.
