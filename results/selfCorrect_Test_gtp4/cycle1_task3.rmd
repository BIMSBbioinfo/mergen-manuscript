prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
First, you need to install the "readxl" package in R, which is used to read excel files.

You can then use the `read_excel` function in the readxl package to read your excel file. The function returns a data frame where rows correspond to the genes and columns correspond to the different cases (or specific gene expression data from different samples).

After reading the data into R, you can use the `nrow` and `ncol` functions to count the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the data set respectively. 

Here is script you can use:

```
# Firstly, you need to install the "readxl" package


# Then load the package
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file into R
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count the number of genes(rows) and samples(columns)
num_genes <- nrow(data)      # number of genes
num_samples <- ncol(data)-1  # number of samples

# print out the results
print(paste("Number of genes: ", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples: ", num_samples))
```

Note: We subtract 1 from the number of columns to get the number of samples, because the first column is not a sample but the gene names.
