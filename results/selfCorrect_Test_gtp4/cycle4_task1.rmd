prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	patient34	63	M	CAUC


response:
Here is the code to read a tab separated file and determine the number of rows and columns it has.

```
# Read tab separated file
subjects <- read.delim("subjects.txt", header=TRUE)

# Number of rows
num_rows <- nrow(subjects)

# Number of columns
num_cols <- ncol(subjects)

# Print the results
print(paste("The number of rows is", num_rows))
print(paste("The number of columns is", num_cols))
```

This code first uses `read.delim()` function with the argument `header=TRUE` to read in the tab separated file and treat the first row as column names. Then, `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions are used to count the number of rows and columns respectively. Finally, the number of rows and columns are printed.
