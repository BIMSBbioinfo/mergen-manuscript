prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	34	63	M	CAUC


response:
```
# Read file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Number of columns
columns_number <- ncol(subjects)
# Number of rows
rows_number <- nrow(subjects)

# Print results
print(paste("Number of columns: ", columns_number))
print(paste("Number of rows: ", rows_number))
```
The "read.table" function reads in a text file and converts it to a data frame. The "header = TRUE" argument tells R that the first line of the file contains column names, and the "sep = '\t'" argument specifies that the file is tab-delimited. The "ncol" and "nrow" functions return the number of columns and rows, respectively, in a data frame.
