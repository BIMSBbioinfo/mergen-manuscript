prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	34	63	M	CAUC


response:
Here is the R code to read the tab separated file and to tell how many rows and columns it has:

```
# Reading the file
df <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(df)
num_cols <- ncol(df)

print(paste("Number of rows: ", num_rows))
print(paste("Number of columns: ", num_cols))
```

This script does the following:

1. Uses `read.table()` to read the tab separated file `subjects.txt` into a data frame `df`. The `header = TRUE` argument means that the first row of the file contains column names.
2. Uses `nrow()` and `ncol()` to get the number of rows and columns in `df`, respectively.
3. Finally, uses `print()` and `paste()` to print out the number of rows and columns.
