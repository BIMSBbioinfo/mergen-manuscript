prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Here is the R code to solve your problem.

First, we will load the necessary libraries and read our two tables. I'm assuming that the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" file is an Excel file, so we'll need to use the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` library, and for "SRP021193.colData.tsv" use `read.table()` function. Then I will rename columns of the SRP021193.colData.tsv file to correctly merge it with the count data. After merging data, to calculate the number of columns, just use the `ncol()` function.

```
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Read data
exp_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
col_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep="\t", header = TRUE)

# rename first column of annotation data to merge
names(col_data)[1] <- "Genes"

# Merge the two dataframes by "Genes" 
merged_data <- left_join(exp_data, col_data, by = "Genes")

# Calculate the number of columns
num_of_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

num_of_columns
```

Please replace the path of your file for the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" files in the `read_excel()` and `read.table()` functions, respectively.
