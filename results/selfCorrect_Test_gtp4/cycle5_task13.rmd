prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA

#Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(readr)

#Read the gene expression data
gene_exp_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", col_names = TRUE)

#Read the sample annotation data
sample_ann_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv", col_names = TRUE)

#Merge the two dataframes by common column values
merged_data <- merge(gene_exp_data, sample_ann_data, by.x = colnames(gene_exp_data)[2], by.y = colnames(sample_ann_data)[1])

#Calculate the number of columns
num_cols <- ncol(merged_data)

num_cols
```
In this snippet, two R libraries are first loaded: `readxl` for reading Excel files and `readr` for reading tsv files. The gene expression data and sample annotation data are then read into data frames using `read_excel` and `read_tsv` respectively, with column names option enabled. The two data frames are then merged using the `merge` function, by matching the names of the first column in gene_exp_data with the names of the first column in sample_ann_data, resulting in a merged data frame. Finally, the number of columns in the merged data frame is calculated using the `ncol` function, and this number is stored in the variable `num_cols`. It will print the number of columns when `num_cols` is called.
