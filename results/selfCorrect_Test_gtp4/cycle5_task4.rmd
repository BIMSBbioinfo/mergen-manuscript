prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
You can use the `read.table` function to load the data into R. This function has an argument `header` which we set to `TRUE` because the first line of the file contains the names of the samples and gene. Then count the number of rows and columns in the data frame for genes and samples respectively. Note that we need to subtract 2 from the `ncol` value because the first column represents the gene names and the last one is the gene length.

```
# load the data
data <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# count the number of genes
gene_count <- nrow(data)

# count the number of samples
sample_count <- ncol(data) - 2

print(paste("The number of genes is", gene_count, "and the number of samples is", sample_count))
```
