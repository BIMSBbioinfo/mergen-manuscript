prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
You can use the `read.table` method in R to read the dataset and then you use the `dim` function to get the number of rows and columns in the dataset. Because the first column contains the gene names and the last column is gene length, you subtract two from the column count to get the sample count.

Here is the R code:

```
# load the .tsv file
data <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# get total number of genes (rows)
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# get total number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(data)

# get total number of samples (subtract 2: one for gene names column and one for gene length)
num_samples <- num_columns - 2

# print the count
print(paste("Number of genes: ", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples: ", num_samples))
```

Please replace "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" with the correct path and filename where your file is located.
