prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
First, you'll need to install and load the necessary libraries. 

```

library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

Lets load and merge datasets.

```
# read the excel file
expr <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# read the tsv file
anno <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# set the row names of expr to the 'Genes' column
rownames(expr) <- expr$Genes

# remove the 'Genes' column
expr <- expr[-1]

# transpose the expr dataframe so that genes are columns and samples are rows
expr_t <- as.data.frame(t(expr))

# merge the annotation data with the expression data
df <- bind_cols(anno, expr_t)
```

Calculate number of columns.

```
# count the number of columns
no_of_cols <- ncol(df)
no_of_cols
```

The variable `no_of_cols` will now hold the number of columns in the merged dataset.
