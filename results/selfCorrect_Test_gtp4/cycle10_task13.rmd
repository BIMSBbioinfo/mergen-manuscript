prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
My sincere apologies for the confusion. The error occurs when attempting to reshape the experiment table, because the column names after reshaping the DataFrame contain both character and numeric type entries. 

The experiment and annotation data need to be merged by sample ID. It appears that the sample ID in the experiment data is the column name excluding the "Genes" column. Let's modify the code accordingly:

```
# Required Libraries
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Read the Excel file
exp_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Make the data tidy
exp_data <- gather(exp_data, LibrarySelection, Count, -Genes)

# Read the tsv file
annot_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Merge operation
merged_data <- merge(annot_data, exp_data, by = "LibrarySelection")

# Calculate number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

num_columns
```

Here, we've used the `gather` function from the `tidyverse` package to reshape the data in `exp_data` so each row corresponds to a single gene-sample ID-expression count observation. This should avoid the error you received in the previous code. This modified the structure of `exp_data` dataframe where the first column ("Genes") contains gene names, the second column ("LibrarySelection") contains the sample IDs, and the third column ("Count") contains the expression count. 

This reshaped data is then merged with the annotation data using the sample ID as the key. The number of columns in the merged data is then calculated.
