prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Apologies for the error. It likely occurred because your RNA-seq data and annotation data have columns of the same names which are conflicting while merging. I will assume that the first columns of both the data frames are unique identifiers used for merging. Here's the corrected code:

```
# Import required libraries
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# Load your RNA-seq data
RNA_seq_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Load your column annotation data
col_annotation <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Rename the first column of the RNA-seq data
names(RNA_seq_data)[1] <- "diagnosis"

# Merge annotation data and gene expression tables
merged_data <- merge(col_annotation, RNA_seq_data, by = "diagnosis")

# Calculate number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
num_columns
```
Assuming that your data files are in your working directory. Otherwise, please replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the full paths to your files.
