prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Load gene expression count data
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", col_names = TRUE)

# Load annotation data
annotation_table <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv", col_names = TRUE)

# Match the samples in both tables based on first column of both dataframes
merged_data <- merge(annotation_table, count_table, by.x = "diagnosis", by.y = "Genes", all.x = TRUE)

# Calculate number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

num_columns
```

In the above R script, first I have loaded the required libraries. Then I read the data from both tables using `read_excel()` for the .xlsx file and `read_tsv()` for the .tsv file, setting `col_names = TRUE` for both, so that the function treats the first row as column names. After loading the data, I merge both tables using the `merge()` function, setting `by.x = "diagnosis"` and `by.y = "Genes"`, to merge on the sample id column, also set `all.x = TRUE` to keep all rows from annotation table, even if there is no match in count table. Then I calculated the number of columns in the merged data using `ncol()`.
