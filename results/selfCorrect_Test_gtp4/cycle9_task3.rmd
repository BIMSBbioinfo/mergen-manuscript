prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
Here is an example of R code that can accomplish this task.

In this code, I am using library `readxl` to read the Excel data into R and then I am using `dim` function to get the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) from this data. Please note the number of samples is calculated as total columns minus one (as first column contains gene names not the sample data).

```
# Load libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the data
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes = nrow(data)
num_samples = ncol(data) - 1

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

Please ensure you've installed the required library. If not, you can install it using `` initially. Also, make sure the provided Excel file "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" exists in your current working directory in R. To check your current working directory, you can use `getwd()` function in R.
