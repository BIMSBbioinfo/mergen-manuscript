prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
You can use the `read_excel` function from the `readxl` package to load your excel data into R. Then, use the `dim` function to check the dimension of your data, which will return a vector containing the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples).

This is done as follows:

```
# Load necessary package
library(readxl)

# Load the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- dim(data)[1]
num_samples <- dim(data)[2] - 1

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

Remember that the first column contains gene names, so I subtract 1 from the total number of columns to get the number of samples. This code does not check if the data file is actually structured that way, so be careful. If the actual structure of your file is different, adjust the code accordingly.
