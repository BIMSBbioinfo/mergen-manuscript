prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0

SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I apologize for the misunderstanding. In this situation, it appears that there might be some confusion because 'FILE_PATH_TO_BE_REPLACED' is a placeholder. You need to replace 'FILE_PATH_TO_BE_REPLACED' with the actual file path to your input files. 'FILE_PATH_TO_BE_REPLACED' is not a valid file path and that's why you're encountering an error. 

Without knowledge of your computer's file system and where the 'Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx' and 'SRP021193.colData.tsv' files are located, it's impossible for me to provide the precise file paths you should use. 

Usually, if the 'Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx' file is located in the Documents directory on a Windows computer, the path could be something like 'C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx'. The path to a file on MacOS could look something like '/Users/YourUsername/Documents/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx'.

Here is the correct code block, assuming that the two files are in your working directory:

```
# Installing necessary packages from Bioconductor
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")

# Install and load other packages

   
# Loading necessary packages
library(DESeq2)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library("FactoMineR")
library("factoextra")

# Loading gene expression data and metadata
# IMPORTANT: Replace 'YOUR_FILE_PATH' with your own file paths
path_to_count_data <- "YOUR_FILE_PATH/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"
path_to_meta_data <- "YOUR_FILE_PATH/SRP021193.colData.tsv"

countdata <- read_excel(path_to_count_data)
coldata <- read.delim(path_to_meta_data, header=TRUE, sep="\t")

row.names(countdata) <- countdata$Genes
countdata <- countdata[,-1] 

# Create DESeqDataSet
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countdata,
                              colData = coldata,
                              design = ~ group)

# Differential gene expression analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)
res <- results(dds)

# Subset data with adjusted p-value < 0.05 
sig_genes <- subset(res, padj < 0.05)

# PCA on significant genes
pca_data <- prcomp(t(counts(dds, normalized=TRUE)[rownames(sig_genes), ]))
res.pca <- PCA(pca_data$x, graph = FALSE)

# Plot PCA and color by group
fviz_pca_biplot(res.pca, 
                col.ind = coldata$group, 
                legend.title = "Group")
```

Please replace 'YOUR_FILE_PATH' with the actual path to your files on your local machine.
