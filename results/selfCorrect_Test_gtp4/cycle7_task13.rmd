prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Here is the R code to merge the data.

```
# Load necessary packages

library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Read data
gene_expression <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merge data
merged_data <- merge(gene_expression, annotation, by.x = "Genes", by.y = "diagnosis", all.x = TRUE)

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

Please replace the filename in `read_excel` and `read_tsv` functions with the path of your actual files if they are not in the current working directory of your R session. The `by.x` and `by.y` arguments in the `merge` function specify the columns to join the tables on. Adjust them according to your data if necessary. The `all.x = TRUE` argument ensures that all rows from the `gene_expression` data frame are included in the merged data frame. Also, `num_columns` variable will store the number of columns in the merged data. If you want to know the number of rows, use `nrow` function instead of `ncol`.
