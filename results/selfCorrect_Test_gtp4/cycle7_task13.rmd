prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
It seems that the actual column names in your data might not correspond to the symbols "diagnosis" and "Genes" that I used as placeholders in the merge function. You need to replace them with the correct column names in your data. Also, it's unclear from your question which column in the excel file corresponds to the 'diagnosis' in the tsv file. I assume it's the first column 'Genes'. Here's the corrected code:

```
# Import required packages
# 
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Read excel and tsv files
expression <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
colData <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Add a new 'Genes' column from the row names in expression data
expression <- data.frame(Genes = row.names(expression), expression)

# Merging named columns from each data frame (assuming that 'diagnosis' in tsv file corresponds to 'Genes' in excel file)
merged <- merge(expression, colData, by.x="Genes", by.y="diagnosis", all = TRUE)

# Calculate number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged)
num_columns
```

Please change the "`Genes`" and "`diagnosis`" back to your actually column's name in your two data sets. Please pay attention to their data pattern, they must be the same type and format.
