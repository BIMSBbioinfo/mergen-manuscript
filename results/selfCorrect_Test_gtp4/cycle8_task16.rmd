prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
My apologies for the confusion. The error you're facing might be due to missing or NA values in the 'group' variable. For ggplot to fill the boxplots with different colors based on 'group', it needs at least one non-NA value in 'group.' Alternatively, it might be a mismatch in your join operation which results in no valid 'group' in df_merged dataframe. So ensure the group variable exists, is named correctly and doesn't only contain NA values. 

Here is the correct R code:

```
# Load necessary packages
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

# Read excel file
df_gene_exp <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read tsv file
df_annotation <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Transpose gene expression data
df_gene_exp <- df_gene_exp %>% gather(Sample, Value, -Genes)

# Set the diagnoses as the rownames before the merge
rownames(df_annotation) <- df_annotation$diagnosis

# Merge data set by diagnosis as sample ID
df_merged <- merge(df_gene_exp, df_annotation, by = "row.names", all.x = TRUE)
rownames(df_merged) <- NULL

# Renaming merged column
names(df_merged)[1] <- "Sample"

# Plot boxplots of gene expression by Sample, colored by group
df_merged <- df_merged %>% drop_na(group)

ggplot(df_merged, aes(x=Sample, y=Value, fill=group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title="Gene Expression per Sample", y="Expression", x="Sample", fill="Group")
```

Please replace 'group' and 'diagnosis' with the respective column names in your data frame if they are different. If the problem continues, it may result from issues with the color or group column in your specific dataset so it would be helpful to get the exact structure and content of your data.
