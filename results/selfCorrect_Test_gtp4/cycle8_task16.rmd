prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I'm sorry for the confusion. It seems that we may be missing values from the 'group' variable. If the 'group' variable doesn't exist or is empty, the fill aesthetic will cause this error. Please check your annotation file for missing values. I will modify the code to proceed if the 'group' column is missing or empty by color-coding with the 'diagnosis'.

```
# install necessary packages
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# read RNA-seq count data from Excel file
count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# read sample annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# reshape data
count_data_long <- count_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -Genes,
    names_to = "diagnosis",
    values_to = "Expression"
  )

# merge datasets
merged_data <- left_join(count_data_long, annotation_data, by = "diagnosis")

if('group' %in% names(merged_data)){
  fill_aes <- "group"
} else {
  fill_aes <- "diagnosis"
}

# plot boxplots of gene expression colored by group
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = diagnosis, y = Expression, fill = !! fill_aes)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + 
  labs(y = "Expression level", x = "Samples", fill = fill_aes)
```
