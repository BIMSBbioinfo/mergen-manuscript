prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I'm sorry for the confusion. Here's an updated version:

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Load gene expression data
geneexp <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Load annotation data
annotation <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# reshape the data for merge

reshaped <- reshape(geneexp, 
           idvar = "Genes",
           varying = list(colnames(geneexp)[2:ncol(geneexp)]),
           direction = "long",
           times = colnames(geneexp)[2:ncol(geneexp)],
           new.row.names = 1:1E6)

names(reshaped)[names(reshaped) == "time"] <- "sample"
names(reshaped)[names(reshaped) == "Genes"] <- "gene"
names(reshaped)[names(reshaped) == "geneexp"] <- "expression"

# Merge reshaped and annotation data
merged <- merge(reshaped, annotation, by.x='sample', by.y='diagnosis')

# Plot boxplot

merged$group <- as.factor(merged$group)
merged$expression <- as.numeric(merged$expression)

ggplot(merged, aes(x=sample, y=expression, fill=group)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

In this code, we reshape the gene expression data, changing it from a wide format to a long format, which aligns it with the annotation data for merging. The final boxplot is colour-coded by group and shows expression per gene per sample.
