prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
The R code provided will read the data from the given files and display the number of rows and columns for each.

Firstly, you'll need to have the required libraries installed. As you are dealing with excel and tsv files, I'm using `readxl` and `readr` libraries. If not already installed, install them using `install.packages()` function.

Here is the code:

```
# Load the required libraries
library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Specify file locations
# Replace file paths in quotes with your actual file paths
count_file_path = "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"
annotation_file_path = "SRP021193.colData.tsv"

# Read the excel and tsv files as data frames
count_data <- read_excel(count_file_path)
annotation_data <- read_tsv(annotation_file_path)

# Display the number of rows and columns for each dataframe
print(paste("Count data : ", nrow(count_data), "rows ", ncol(count_data), "columns"))
print(paste("Annotation data : ", nrow(annotation_data), "rows", ncol(annotation_data), "columns"))
```

This R code does the following:

1. Loads the required libraries.
2. Specifies the file locations of the .xlsx and .tsv files.
3. Reads the excel and tsv files into R as data frames.
4. Prints the number of rows and columns for each data frame.
