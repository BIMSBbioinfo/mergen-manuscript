prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	34	63	M	CAUC


response:
You can use the `read.table` function to read the file and the `dim` function to get the number of rows and columns in the dataframe. Here's the code:

```
# Read the data
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(subjects)
num_cols <- ncol(subjects)

# Print the number of rows and columns
print(paste("Number of Rows: ", num_rows))
print(paste("Number of Columns: ", num_cols))
```
Note: You should replace "subjects.txt" with your actual file path if it is not in your current working directory. The `header = TRUE` argument tells R that the first row of the file contains the column names and the `sep = "\t"` argument tells R that the columns are separated by tabs. The `paste` function is used to concatenate strings and print them.
