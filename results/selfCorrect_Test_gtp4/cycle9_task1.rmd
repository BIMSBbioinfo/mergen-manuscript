prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	patient34	63	M	CAUC


response:
You can read the "subjects.txt" file using the `read.table()` function. Then, use the `dim()` function to get the number of rows and columns.

Here is the R code for your task:

```
# Read the file
df <- read.table("subjects.txt", header=TRUE, sep="\t")

# Print the number of rows and columns
cat("Number of rows: ", nrow(df), "\n")
cat("Number of columns: ", ncol(df), "\n")
```
