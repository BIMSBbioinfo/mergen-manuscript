prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
To perform this task, we will need to use several R packages: "tidyverse" for data cleaning and manipulation, "readxl" for reading the excel files, "DESeq2" for normalizing RNA-seq counts and "ggfortify" for PCA plots.

First, install required packages using the install.packages() function if you have not done so yet. 

```




```

Then, proceed to load the libraries.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggfortify)
```
 
Let's read the two input files.

```
counts <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
colData <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

Define the row names of counts data so that you can use DESeqDataSetFromMatrix. 

```
rownames(counts) <- counts$Genes
counts$Genes <- NULL
```

Then before normalizing the count data, the two tables will have to be combined into a DESeq object.

```
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts, colData = colData, design = ~ 1)
```

Normalize the count data.

```
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
```

At this point, you can create PCA plots, one for "group" and the other for "LibrarySelection".

Group PCA plot.
```
autoplot(prcomp(t(normalized_counts)), data = colData, colour = 'group') 
```

LibrarySelection PCA plot.
```
autoplot(prcomp(t(normalized_counts)), data = colData, colour = 'LibrarySelection')
```

To note, this pipeline assumes that "group" and "LibrarySelection" are factors in colData which need coloring on the PCA plots. All file paths are also assumed to be from the working directory (you may need to provide the correct file paths).
