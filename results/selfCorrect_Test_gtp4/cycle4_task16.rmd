prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Firstly, you should install and import necessary libraries to read .xlsx and .tsv files and create a boxplot.

Then, read the gene expression data and annotation data into data frames. Note that `read_excel` takes the first column as rownames by default hence no need to specify `row.names`. Next, you should merge these data frames based on column names that match sample IDs. After merging, you can plot a boxplot.

```
# Install necessary libraries

library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Reading the gene expression and annotation data
gene_exp <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merging the gene expression and annotation data
merged <- merge(gene_exp, annotation, by = "row.names")
colnames(merged)[1] <- "Sample"

# Transforming data to long for plotting
merged_long <- gather(merged, Sample, Expression, -group)

# Creating a boxplot of the gene expression data, colored by group
ggplot(merged_long, aes(x = Sample, y = Expression, fill = group)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
In the boxplot, each box represents expression values for a single sample, and different groups are distinguished by color. You may need to adjust the angle of x-axis labels for better reading. Moreover, "group", "Sample" and "Expression" are assumed column names and may need to be adjusted to match actual column names in your dataset. Adapt this code according to your dataset.
