prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Here's a sample R code to fulfill your requirements.

The readxl and ggplot2 libraries are required, install and load them with:

```

library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

You can read the excel file and tsv file using these commands and merging them:

```
# Read data files
gene_exp_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Convert wide format gene_exp_data to long format
long_gene_exp_data <- gene_exp_data %>% pivot_longer(cols = -Genes, names_to = "diagnosis", values_to = "expression")

# Merge with annotation_data
merged_data <- left_join(long_gene_exp_data, annotation_data, by = "diagnosis")
```

The boxplot can be created by using ggplot. Here the boxplot color is based on "group".

```
# Create boxplot
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = diagnosis, y = expression, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Sample", y = "Expression", fill = "Group", title = "Gene Expression per Sample")
```
The pivot_longer function transforms the data from wide to long format which is more useful for ggplot. Then the data is merged using left_join operation. Finally, we use ggplot2 to make the box plots.

Please remember to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with your actual paths if they reside in a different directory.
