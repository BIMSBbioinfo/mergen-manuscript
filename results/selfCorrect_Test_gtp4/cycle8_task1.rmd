here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race

response:
```
# we can use the read.table function in R to read in a tab separated file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# You can use the dim function to find the number of rows and columns
dimensions <- dim(subjects)

# You can print out the number of rows and columns like this
print(paste("Number of rows: ", dimensions[1]))
print(paste("Number of columns: ", dimensions[2]))
```
