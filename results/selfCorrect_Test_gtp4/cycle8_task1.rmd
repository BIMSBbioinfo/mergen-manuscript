prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	patient34	63	M	CAUC


response:
To accomplish this task, you first have to read the tab-separated file into an object in R. I'll utilize `read.table()` function to read the file. And then, provide the number of rows and columns it has using the `dim()` function.

Here is the R code for this:

```
# Read the file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Number of rows and columns
dim(subjects)
```

The `dim()` function, when applied to a data frame in R, returns a vector with two elements. The first element corresponds to the number of rows and the second element to the number of columns.
