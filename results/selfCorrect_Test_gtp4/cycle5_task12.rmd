prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
The following R code may be used to read, display the number of rows and columns of each of the Excel and tsv data, which are Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx and SRP021193.colData.tsv respectively. 

```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Read count table from excel file
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Display number of rows and columns of count table
print(paste("Count table rows: ", nrow(count_table)))
print(paste("Count table columns: ", ncol(count_table)))

# Read annotation data from tsv file
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Display number of rows and columns of annotation data
print(paste("Annotation data rows: ", nrow(annotation_data)))
print(paste("Annotation data columns: ", ncol(annotation_data)))
```

This code presumes that the required files are located in the current working directory and that you have required packages installed. If not, you should install by executing ``.
