prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
To find out the number of genes and samples in the dataset, you can use the readxl function to read the dataset and then use the dim function to get the number of rows (genes) and the columns (samples). To do this, you first need to install and load the readxl package. Here's how to do it:

```
# Check whether package 'readxl' is installed then install it and load
if (!require(readxl)) 

library(readxl)

# read the xlsx file into a dataframe
dataset <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
  
# find the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(dataset) - 1  # We subtract 1 here because the first row is the header
num_samples <- ncol(dataset) - 1  # Subtract 1 here because the first column is not a sample, but the gene names

# print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples)
```

Please note that this code assumes that the file "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" is in your current working directory. If not, you'll need to provide the full path. Also, we subtract one from the number of rows and the number of columns to account for the header row and the column containing gene names.
