prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
You can use the `readxl` and `readr` packages to read the `.xlsx` and `.tsv` files respectively in R. Once you have the dataframes loaded in R, you can use the `dim` function to determine the count of rows and columns. 

Here is how you can do it:

```
# install packages if they're not installed already
if(!require(readxl)) 
if(!require(readr)) 

# Load the packages
library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Read the .xlsx file - you have to specify the path to the file if it's not in the current working directory
RNA_seq_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the .tsv file - you have to specify the path to the file if it's not in the current working directory
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Print count number of rows and columns for each file
print(paste("RNA_seq_data:", "Number of rows: ", nrow(RNA_seq_data), ", Number of columns: ", ncol(RNA_seq_data)))
print(paste("annotation_data:", "Number of rows: ", nrow(annotation_data), ", Number of columns: ", ncol(annotation_data)))
```

Remember to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual paths to your files if they are not in your current working directory. The above code block will print the count number of rows and columns for each file.
