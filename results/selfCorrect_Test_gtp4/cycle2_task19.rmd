prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
My apologies for the confusion earlier. It seems the colnames and the rownames for the countData and colData are not matching. This could happen If the samples are not ordered identically in the Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx and SRP021193.colData.tsv files.

We could set the rownames of colData to the first column to fix this, here is the updated code:

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Load Data
ExpData <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
colData <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE, sep="\t")

# Set the rownames to the first column
rownames(colData) <- colData[, 1]

# Prepare data for DESeq2
rownames(ExpData) <- ExpData$Genes
countData <- ExpData[, -1]

# Make sure the order of metadata matches with the column order of your count data
colData <- colData[colnames(countData),]

# Create DESeqDataSet
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countData,
                              colData = colData,
                              design = ~ group)

# Run DESeq
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# PCA plots
plotPCA(dds, intgroup = "group")
plotPCA(dds, intgroup = "LibrarySelection")
```
I hope this code works without any issues. Please make sure that your working directory is set correctly to the folder containing your files.
