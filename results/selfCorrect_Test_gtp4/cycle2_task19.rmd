prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I apologize for overlooking that. The error you're encountering happens when there are duplicate row names. In R, every row must have a unique row name. Here is your updated code:

```
library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Load data
exp <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# If genes names are not unique, make them unique
rownames(exp) <- make.names(exp$Genes, unique = TRUE)
exp$Genes <- NULL

anno <- read.csv("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep="\t", header = TRUE)

# Match the column order of the count data to the row order of the sample names
exp <- exp[, match(colnames(exp), rownames(anno))]

# Create a DESeq2 object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = exp, colData = anno, design = ~ LibrarySelection + group)

# Perform normalization
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
norm_counts <- counts(dds, normalized=TRUE)

# Perform PCA Analysis
PCA <- prcomp(t(norm_counts))

# Create PCA Plots
pca_data <- data.frame(PC1 = PCA$x[, 1], PC2 = PCA$x[, 2], group = anno$group, LibrarySelection = anno$LibrarySelection)

# Plot by group
p1 <- ggplot(data = pca_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  ggtitle("PCA colored by group")

# Plot by LibrarySelection
p2 <- ggplot(data = pca_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  ggtitle("PCA colored by LibrarySelection")

# Print the plots
print(p1)
print(p2)
```
This code checks the genes names in your dataset, if they are not unique, it will automatically make them unique, and then it will proceed with the PCA analysis and the creation of the scatter plots.
