prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Below is the R code to achieve your tasks. It uses the `readxl` and `readr` packages to read Excel and tsv file formats respectively. After reading both data files into R as data frames, the `merge` function is used to join them. The number of columns in the final merged data frame is then calculated using the `ncol` function.

```
# Load necessary packages
library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Read the excel and tsv files
expr_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annot_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merge the two data frames based on the sample ids
merged_data <- merge(expr_data, annot_data, by.x="Genes", by.y="diagnosis", all = TRUE)

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

Note: Ensure you properly set your working directory to the folder containing these files before running the code, or include the full path to these files in the `read_excel` and `read_tsv` functions. If the annotation data has column names that also appear in the gene expression data, you may need to adjust the names to avoid duplicates after merging.
