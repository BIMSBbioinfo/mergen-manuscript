prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA

Here is the R code:

```
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# read the gene expression data from excel file
gene_expr <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# read the annotation data from tab separated file
annotation <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# transpose the gene expression data so that samples become rows
t_gene_expr <- t(gene_expr)

# add the genenames column to the transposed gene expression data
t_gene_expr <- data.frame(genenames = rownames(t_gene_expr), t_gene_expr)

# make sure that samples are characters not factor to avoid problems in merging
annotation$diagnosis <- as.character(annotation$diagnosis)
t_gene_expr$genenames <- as.character(t_gene_expr$genenames)

# set the rownames to NULL
rownames(t_gene_expr) <- NULL
rownames(annotation) <- NULL

# merge the two dataframes by samples
merged_data <- inner_join(annotation, t_gene_expr, by = c("diagnosis"="genenames"))

# calculate number of columns 
num_of_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

num_of_columns
```

This code reads both the RNA-seq count table and the sample annotation data, and merges them based on the sample IDs (assuming that these IDs in the gene expression data are the same as the 'diagnosis' IDs in the annotation data). Please, replace the file paths with the correct ones on your local system. The number of columns in the merged data is calculated with the ncol function.
