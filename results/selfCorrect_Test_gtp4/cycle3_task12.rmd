prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
You can use the `readxl` package in R to read data from an Excel file and the `read.table` function to read data from a tsv file. Here is the code:

```
# Load required library

library(readxl)

# Read the data from "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"
exp_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count number of rows and columns for the expression data
nrow_exp <- nrow(exp_data)
ncol_exp <- ncol(exp_data)

# Read the data from "SRP021193.colData.tsv"
col_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count number of rows and columns for the annotations data
nrow_col <- nrow(col_data)
ncol_col <- ncol(col_data)

list(nrow_exp = nrow_exp, ncol_exp = ncol_exp, nrow_col = nrow_col, ncol_col = ncol_col)
```

This code first reads the data from the two files, then counts the number of rows and columns in each data frame, and then returns these values in a list. The `read.table` function uses TAB as the separator (`sep = "\t"`), as this is the standard separator in a `.tsv` file. Note that the path of your files might differ from the one given in the code.
