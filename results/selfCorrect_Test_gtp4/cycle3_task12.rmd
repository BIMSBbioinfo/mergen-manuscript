prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Below is the R code that can be used to perform the task:

```
#load required packages
library(readxl)
library(readr)

#read the count table
count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

#display the dimensions of the count table
print(paste("Number of rows in the count table: ", nrow(count_data)))
print(paste("Number of columns in the count table: ", ncol(count_data)))

#read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

#display the dimensions of the annotation data
print(paste("Number of rows in the annotation data: ", nrow(annotation_data)))
print(paste("Number of columns in the annotation data: ", ncol(annotation_data)))

```

Please ensure that the paths to the files "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" in the code are correct. If these files are not in your R working directory, full paths to the files may need to be provided.
