prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Here is the R code to read in the count table from the xlsx file and the sample annotations from the TSV file and to get the dimensions of each.

First, you will need to install the necessary R packages: "readxl" for reading Excel files, and "readr" for reading TSV files. 

```
# Install necessary packages


# Load necessary packages
library(readxl)
library(readr)
```

Then, read in the data from the Excel file (stored in the variable `count_table`) and the TSV file (stored in the variable `annotations`):

```
# Read the count table from the xlsx file
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the sample annotations from the TSV file
annotations <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

Finally, print the dimensions of each:

```
# Get the number of rows and columns in the count table
cat("The count table has", nrow(count_table), "rows and", ncol(count_table), "columns.\n")

# Get the number of rows and columns in the annotations table
cat("The annotations table has", nrow(annotations), "rows and", ncol(annotations), "columns.")
```

Note: Make sure you replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual paths to those files on your system if they are not in your working directory.
