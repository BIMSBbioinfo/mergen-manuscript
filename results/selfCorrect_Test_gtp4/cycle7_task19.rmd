prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
I apologize for the confusion. Let's revise the code to match the column names of our count data to our colData object's order.

```
library(DESeq2)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)

# read files
count_data <- read_xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
coldata <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, sep = "\t")

# Set the diagnosis as rownames
rownames(coldata) <- coldata$diagnosis

# Reorder the count data based on coldata order
count_data <- count_data[, c(1, match(rownames(coldata), colnames(count_data[-1])) + 1)]

# Check if they are in the same order
all(colnames(count_data[-1]) == rownames(coldata))

# create DESeq2 dataset
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_data[,-1],
                              colData = coldata,
                              design = ~ group)

# perform size factor estimation for normalization
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
norm_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA
 pca_data <- prcomp(t(norm_counts))

# Create PCA plots
 ggplot(pca_data$x, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = coldata$group)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(color = "group")

 ggplot(pca_data$x, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = coldata$LibrarySelection)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(color = "LibrarySelection")
```
In this code, I reordered count_data to match the order of the coldata by matching the rownames of the coldata with the count_data column names. This way, the samples in the count_data and coldata dataframe are in the same order, which is a requirement for creating the DESeqDataSet.
