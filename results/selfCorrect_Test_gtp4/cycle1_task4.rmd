prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
To know the total number of genes and samples in the dataset, you can use the read.table function to read the data and then use the dim function to know the dimensions of the data. Here, rows represent genes and columns represent samples.

You should subtract two from the total number of columns because the dataset includes the width column and the gene names row, which aren't samples.

```
# Read the data from the file
data <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Find the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# Find the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 2

# Print the number of genes
print(num_genes)

# Print the number of samples
print(num_samples)
```
This script reads the data file, fetches the number of rows and columns, and then prints the number of genes and samples. The "-2" is necessary to account for the column of gene names and the column for gene length, which are not actual sample data.
