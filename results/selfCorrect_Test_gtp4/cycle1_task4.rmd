prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
To answer your question, we can read the tsv file into a dataframe in R using the function `read.table()`. To get the number of samples we can use the `ncol()` function, subtracting 2 for the gene names and gene length columns. To get the number of genes, we can use the `nrow()` function.

The R code for this would look like:

```
# Read the tsv file
data <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = T, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of samples
samples <- ncol(data) - 2

# Get the number of genes
genes <- nrow(data)

# Print the number of samples and genes
print(paste("Number of samples: ", samples))
print(paste("Number of genes: ", genes))
```

Please replace `"SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv"` with the actual path to your file if it's not in the working directory.
