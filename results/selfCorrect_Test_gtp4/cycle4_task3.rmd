prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
The number of genes and samples can be calculated using the `dim()` function in R which gives the number of rows and columns in a data frame. The function `readxl::read_excel()` can be used to read the excel file and convert it to a data frame.

Here is the R code:

```
# Load required library
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- readxl::read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Print number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes: ", nrow(data), "\n")
cat("Number of samples: ", ncol(data) - 1, "\n") # subtract 1 to not count the gene names column
```

This code reads the excel file, then uses the `nrow()` function to find the number of genes (rows) and `ncol()` function to find the number of samples (columns). The `cat()` function is used to print these values to the console. Note that we subtract 1 from the number of columns to not count the gene names column as a sample.
