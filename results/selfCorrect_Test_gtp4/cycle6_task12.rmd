prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
	diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA


response:
Here is the R code which reads the excel and tsv file. After reading the files, it prints the number of rows and columns in each data frame.

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Read count data table
count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Print number of rows and columns for count data
cat("Number of Rows in count data: ", nrow(count_data), "\n")
cat("Number of Columns in count data: ", ncol(count_data), "\n")

# Print number of rows and columns for annotation data
cat("Number of Rows in annotation data: ", nrow(annotation_data), "\n")
cat("Number of Columns in annotation data: ", ncol(annotation_data), "\n")
```
Note: This code will execute only if you have the required packages installed and these files in your current R working directory. Be careful with file path if it is different. Please replace the file path according to your system if needed.
