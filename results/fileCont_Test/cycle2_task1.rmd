prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	34	63	M	CAUC


response:
```
# Read the tab separated file
data <- read.delim("subjects.txt", sep="\t")

# Count the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_cols <- ncol(data)

# Output the results
num_rows
num_cols

Note: Make sure to replace "subjects.txt" with the correct file path to read the file.
