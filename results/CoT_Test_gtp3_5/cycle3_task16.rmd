prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, we can use the R packages `readxl` and `dplyr`. Here are the steps to accomplish this task:

1. Install and load the necessary packages:
```



library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data:
```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

3. Merge the two tables based on sample ids:
```
merged_data <- count_table %>%
  left_join(annotation_data, by = c("sample_id" = "Sample"))
```

4. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample:
```
# Assuming the column names of count table contain sample ids
boxplot_data <- count_table[, -1] # Exclude the first column (gene names)
boxplot(boxplot_data, col = merged_data$group)
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the correct file paths for your data.
