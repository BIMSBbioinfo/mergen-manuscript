prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, we can use the R packages `readxl` and `dplyr`. First, we read the count table and annotation data into R using the appropriate functions. Then, we can merge the two tables based on the matching sample IDs. Finally, we can plot boxplots of the gene expression values per sample and color code them based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Install and load the necessary packages:

```
  # Install the readxl package
   # Install the dplyr package

library(readxl)  # Load the readxl package
library(dplyr)   # Load the dplyr package
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data into R:

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")  # Read the count table
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")       # Read the annotation data
```

3. Merge the annotation data and gene expression tables based on the sample IDs:

```
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = "Gene")
```

4. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code them based on the "group" variable:

```
boxplot_data <- merged_data[, grepl("^Sample_", colnames(merged_data))]  # Select only the gene expression columns

boxplot(boxplot_data, 
        col = merged_data$group,          # Color code boxplots based on the "group" variable
        main = "Gene Expression Boxplots", # Title of the plot
        xlab = "Sample",                    # X-axis label
        ylab = "Expression Value")          # Y-axis label
```

This code will merge the annotation data and gene expression tables and then generate a boxplot showing the gene expression values per sample, with the boxplots color-coded based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.

Note: Make sure to replace the file paths `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual paths to your files. Also, ensure that the column names for sample IDs in the annotation data and gene expression tables match (e.g., both are named "sample_id" in this example).
