prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will need to perform the following steps:
1. Read the count table and annotation data.
2. Transpose the count table to have samples as rows and genes as columns.
3. Subset the count table to include only the genes specific to each group.
4. Perform statistical tests to identify the genes specific to each group.
5. Plot PCA using the subsetted count table and color code by the "group" variable in the annotation data.

Let's start by reading the count table and annotation data.

```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
```

```
# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep="\t")
```

Now, we will transpose the count table and subset it to include only the genes specific to each group.

```
# Transpose count table
count_table <- t(count_table)
```

To find genes specific for each group, we will perform statistical tests. One commonly used approach is the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. To illustrate this, I will assume that the "group" variable in the annotation data is a categorical variable with multiple levels (e.g., "group1", "group2", "group3").

```
# Perform ANOVA test for each gene
p_values <- apply(count_table, 1, function(gene_counts) {
  fit <- aov(gene_counts ~ annotation_data$group)
  summary(fit)$coef[, "Pr(>F)"]
})

# Set significance threshold (e.g., p-value < 0.05)
significant_genes <- rownames(count_table)[p_values < 0.05]

# Subset count table to include only the significant genes
count_table_subset <- count_table[significant_genes, ]
```

Finally, we can plot the PCA using the subsetted count table and color code by the "group" variable in the annotation data.

```
# Perform PCA
pca <- prcomp(count_table_subset)

# Create data frame for plotting
pca_df <- as.data.frame(pca$x[, 1:2])
colnames(pca_df) <- c("PC1", "PC2")
pca_df$group <- annotation_data$group

# Plot PCA with color coding by "group"
ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = rownames(pca_df)), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "PCA plot", x = "PC1", y = "PC2")
```

Please note that the code assumes that the count table has proper row and column names matching the gene names and sample IDs, respectively. Also, the code assumes that the annotation data has a column named "group" which represents the groups to compare. You may need to modify the code accordingly if your data structure is different.
