prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To accomplish this task, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the count table and annotation data.
2. Perform statistical tests to identify group-specific genes.
3. Filter the count table to include only the group-specific genes.
4. Perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the filtered count table.
5. Plot the PCA, color-coded by the "group" variable.

Let's write the code to achieve this:

```
# Load required libraries
library(edgeR)  # For statistical testing
library(DESeq2)  # For differential expression analysis
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting

# Step 1: Read count table and annotation data

# Read count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# Step 2: Perform statistical tests to identify group-specific genes

# Prepare the count matrix for edgeR analysis
count_matrix <- as.matrix(count_table)

# Create the group labels based on the "group" variable in annotation data
group_labels <- annotation_data$group

# Perform differential expression analysis using edgeR
dge <- DGEList(counts = count_matrix, group = group_labels)
dge <- calcNormFactors(dge)
dge <- estimateDisp(dge)
fit <- glmFit(dge)

# Perform statistical tests to identify group-specific genes
group_specific_genes <- decideTests(fit, contrast = c("group", "groupA", "groupB", "groupC"), adjust.method = "BH", lfc = 1.0)

# Filter count table to include only group-specific genes
filtered_count_table <- count_table[group_specific_genes$DE.all, ]

# Step 4: Perform PCA on the filtered count table

# Transpose the filtered count table for PCA analysis
filtered_count_table_transposed <- t(filtered_count_table)

# Perform PCA using prcomp function
pca <- prcomp(filtered_count_table_transposed)

# Extract PCA components
pca_components <- as.data.frame(pca$x)

# Step 5: Plot the PCA, color-coded by the "group" variable

# Add the "group" variable as a column to pca_components data.frame
pca_components$group <- annotation_data[group_specific_genes$DE.all, "group"]

# Plot PCA, color-coded by "group" variable
ggplot(data = pca_components, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA: Group-Specific Genes")

```
Please note that this code assumes you have the required libraries installed. If you don't have them installed, you can use the `install.packages()` function to install them before running the code.

The code provided reads the count table and annotation data, performs statistical tests to identify group-specific genes, filters the count table to include only the group-specific genes, performs PCA on the filtered count table, and finally plots the PCA, color-coded by the "group" variable.
