prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To filter genes based on their variability and retain the top 1000 most variable genes, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the gene expression data from the "leukemiaExp.txt" file.
2. Calculate the variance for each gene across all samples.
3. Sort the genes based on their variance in descending order.
4. Select the top 1000 genes with the highest variance.
5. Plot a heatmap with clustering using the selected variable genes.
6. Plot the principal component analysis (PCA) for the samples.

Here's the code to perform these steps:

```
# Step 1: Read the gene expression data
gene_exp <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Step 2: Calculate the variance for each gene across all samples
gene_var <- apply(gene_exp, 1, var)

# Step 3: Sort the genes based on their variance in descending order
sorted_genes <- sort(gene_var, decreasing = TRUE)

# Step 4: Select the top 1000 genes with the highest variance
top_genes <- names(sorted_genes)[1:1000]

# Step 5: Plot a heatmap with clustering using the selected variable genes
library(pheatmap)
heatmap_data <- gene_exp[top_genes, ]
heatmap(heatmap_data, main = "Gene Expression Heatmap")

# Step 6: Plot the principal component analysis (PCA) for the samples
library(ggplot2)
library(ggfortify)
pca <- prcomp(t(gene_exp))
autoplot(pca, data = gene_exp, colour = "Sample")
```

Note: Make sure you have the `pheatmap`, `ggplot2`, and `ggfortify` packages installed before running the code. You can install them using the `install.packages()` function if needed.
