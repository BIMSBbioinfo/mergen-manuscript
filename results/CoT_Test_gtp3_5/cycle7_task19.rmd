prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To solve this task, we will use the R programming language and certain packages for data manipulation and visualization. Here are the steps to normalize the counts and create the two PCA plots:

Step 1: Install and load the necessary packages.
```
  # for reading Excel files
   # for data manipulation
  # for count normalization
 # for plotting
 # for color palettes

library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

Step 2: Read the count table and annotation data.
```
count_file <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"
annotation_file <- "SRP021193.colData.tsv"

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel(count_file)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim(annotation_file, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Step 3: Prepare the data for DESeq2: extracting sample identifiers and converting count table to matrix.
```
# Extract sample identifiers from annotation data
sample_ids <- annotation_data$SampleID

# Set the row names of the count table as gene names
rownames(count_table) <- count_table[,1]

# Convert count table to matrix
count_mat <- as.matrix(count_table[, -1])
```

Step 4: Normalize the counts using DESeq2's median ratio method.
```
# Create DESeq2 dataset object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_mat, colData = annotation_data, design = ~ 1)

# Normalize counts
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Extract normalized counts
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
```

Step 5: Perform PCA on the normalized counts and create the first PCA plot (color coded by "group").
```
# Perform PCA on normalized counts
pca_data <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Create a dataframe for PCA plot
pca_plot_data <- data.frame(PC1 = pca_data$x[,1], PC2 = pca_data$x[,2], group = annotation_data$group)

# Create PCA plot (color coded by "group")
pca_plot_1 <- ggplot(pca_plot_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (color coded by Group)")

# Show the PCA plot
print(pca_plot_1)
```

Step 6: Create the second PCA plot (color coded by "LibrarySelection").
```
# Create a dataframe for PCA plot
pca_plot_data2 <- data.frame(PC1 = pca_data$x[,1], PC2 = pca_data$x[,2], 
                            LibrarySelection = annotation_data$LibrarySelection)

# Create PCA plot (color coded by "LibrarySelection")
pca_plot_2 <- ggplot(pca_plot_data2, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (color coded by LibrarySelection)")

# Show the PCA plot
print(pca_plot_2)
```

That's it! By following these steps, you will have normalized the counts and created two PCA plots, one color coded by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" from the annotation data.

Please note that the code assumes the input files are in the same directory as the R script. You may need to modify the file paths if the files are located elsewhere.
