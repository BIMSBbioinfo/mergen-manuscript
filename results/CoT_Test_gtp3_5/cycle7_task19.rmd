prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the R programming language and several bioinformatics packages. Here is a step-by-step approach to normalize the counts, create two PCA plots, and color code them according to the "group" and "LibrarySelection" annotations.

Step 1: Import the necessary packages
```
# Install the required packages if not already installed


# Load the packages
library(readxl)
library(limma)
library(edgeR)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
library(pcaMethods)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

Step 2: Read the count table and annotation data
```
# Read the count table from the Excel file
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t", row.names = 1)
```

Step 3: Normalize the counts
Since RNA-seq count data often has high variation, it is important to normalize the counts before performing downstream analyses. Here, we will use the TMM (trimmed mean of M-values) normalization method from the edgeR package.

```
# Convert the count table to a matrix
count_matrix <- as.matrix(count_table[, -1])

# Create a DGEList object for edgeR analysis
dge <- DGEList(counts = count_matrix)

# Perform the TMM normalization
dge <- calcNormFactors(dge, method = "TMM")
normalized_counts <- cpm(dge)
```

Step 4: Perform PCA using normalized counts
We will use the pcaMethods package to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the normalized counts.

```
# Create a pcaSet object for PCA analysis
pca_set <- pcaSet(t(normalized_counts))

# Perform PCA
pca_result <- pca(pca_set, method = "svd")

# Extract the PCA scores
pca_scores <- pData(pca_result)$scores
```

Step 5: Create the first PCA plot with color coding by "group"
```
# Join the annotation data with the PCA scores
pca_df <- cbind.data.frame(pca_scores, annotation_data)

# Create the first PCA plot
pca_plot_1 <- ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", color = "Group") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")

# Display the first PCA plot
pca_plot_1
```

Step 6: Create the second PCA plot with color coding by "LibrarySelection"
```
# Create the second PCA plot
pca_plot_2 <- ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", color = "Library Selection") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2")

# Display the second PCA plot
pca_plot_2
```

That's it! By following these steps and running the provided R code, you should be able to normalize the counts, create two PCA plots, and color code them according to the "group" and "LibrarySelection" annotations.

Note: Please make sure that the count table file "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and the annotation data file "SRP021193.colData.tsv" are in the same directory as the R script. Also, verify that the column names in the count table match the row names in the annotation data for correct merging.
