prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will need to use the R programming language and some bioinformatics packages. Here is the step-by-step process to normalize the counts, create PCA plots, and color code them based on the sample annotation data.

Step 1: Load the required R packages
```
# Install the required packages if not already installed


# Load the required packages
library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Step 2: Read the count table and annotation data
```
# Read the count table from the Excel file
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data from the TSV file
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

Step 3: Normalize the counts using DESeq2
```
# Convert the count table to DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table[, -1], colData = annotation_data, design = ~1)

# Perform size factor normalization
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)

# Perform variance stabilizing transformation (VST)
# This step is optional, but often improves the analysis
dds <- vst(dds, blind=FALSE)

# Extract normalized counts
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
```

Step 4: Perform PCA on the normalized counts
```
# Calculate sample-wise Euclidean distances based on the normalized counts
distances <- dist(t(normalized_counts))

# Perform PCA on the distances
pca <- prcomp(distances, scale = TRUE)

# Extract the PC scores
pca_scores <- pca$x
```

Step 5: Create the first PCA plot color-coded by group
```
# Merge the PCA scores with the annotation data
pca_data <- cbind(pca_scores, annotation_data)

# Create the first PCA plot color-coded by group
ggplot(pca_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", color = "group") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Step 6: Create the second PCA plot color-coded by LibrarySelection
```
# Create the second PCA plot color-coded by LibrarySelection
ggplot(pca_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", color = "LibrarySelection") +
  theme_minimal()
```

That's it! Following the provided steps and executing the code will normalize the counts, create two PCA plots, and color code them based on the sample annotations specified in the annotation data.
