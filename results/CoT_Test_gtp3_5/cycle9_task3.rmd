prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the openxlsx package in R to read the excel sheet and count the rows and columns.

Here's the step-by-step code to accomplish this:

```
# Load the required library
library(openxlsx)

# Specify the file path
file_path <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"

# Read the excel sheet
data <- read.xlsx(file_path, sheet = 1)

# Count the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples)
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the gene names column

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the actual file path to your excel sheet.

This code will output the number of genes and samples in the dataset.
