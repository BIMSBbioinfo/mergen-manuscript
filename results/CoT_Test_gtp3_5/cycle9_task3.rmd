prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the gene expression dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then extract the necessary information.

First, let's install and load the `readxl` package:

```
  # Install readxl package
library(readxl)  # Load readxl package
```

Next, we can use the `read_excel()` function to read the Excel file and store it in a data frame:

```
gene_expression_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

Now, to find the number of genes and samples, we can use the `dim()` function to get the dimensions of the data frame:

```
num_genes <- dim(gene_expression_data)[1]  # Number of rows (genes)
num_samples <- dim(gene_expression_data)[2] - 1  # Number of columns minus the gene name column
```

Finally, we can print the results:

```
num_genes
num_samples
```

This will give you the number of genes and samples in the dataset.
