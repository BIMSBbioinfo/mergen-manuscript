prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the count table file and count the number of columns (excluding the first and last column) to get the number of samples, and the number of rows to get the number of genes.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
# Read the count table file
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns)
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2  # Exclude the first and last column

# Print the results
paste("Number of genes:", num_genes)
paste("Number of samples:", num_samples)
```

Note: Make sure to specify the correct file path for the `read.table()` function.
