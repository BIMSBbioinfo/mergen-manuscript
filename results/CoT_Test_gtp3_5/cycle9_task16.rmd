prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data with the gene expression table and plot the boxplots color-coded by group, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the necessary libraries:
```
library(readxl)  # for reading Excel files
library(tidyverse)  # for data manipulation and visualization
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data into R:
```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

3. Merge the two data frames based on the sample ids:
```
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "SampleID", by.y = "sample")
```

4. Plot the boxplots:
```
# Set the colors for each group
group_colors <- c("Group1" = "blue", "Group2" = "red", "Group3" = "green")

# Create the boxplot
boxplot_data <- gather(merged_data, "gene", "expression", -SampleID, -group)
ggplot(boxplot_data, aes(x = group, y = expression, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = group_colors) +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression", title = "Gene Expression Boxplots")
```

This code assumes that the first column in "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" is the gene names, and the first column in "SRP021193.colData.tsv" is the sample ids. Adjust the column names accordingly if they are different in your files.

Make sure to change the file paths in the `read_excel()` and `read_tsv()` functions to match the location of your files on your computer.
