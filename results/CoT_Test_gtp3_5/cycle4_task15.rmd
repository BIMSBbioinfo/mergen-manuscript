prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Read the data and merge them into a single table using dbGapId information. Plot a scatter plot of CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects in the samples.

response:
To solve this task, we'll need to use the R programming language and some popular bioinformatics libraries, such as `tidyverse` and `ggplot2`. Here's a step-by-step approach to merge the datasets and create a scatter plot:

Step 1: Load necessary libraries and read the datasets into R.

```
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)
```

Step 2: Merge the datasets based on the matching dbGap ID.

```
# Merge datasets based on dbGap ID
merged_data <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGap ID")
```

Step 3: Filter out the two oldest subjects.

```
# Filter for the two oldest subjects
oldest_subjects <- merged_data %>% 
  arrange(desc(Age)) %>% 
  head(2)
```

Step 4: Create a scatter plot of CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects.

```
# Create scatter plot
ggplot(oldest_subjects, aes(x = CpG_id, y = methylation)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects",
       x = "CpG ID", y = "Methylation level") +
  theme_minimal()
```

And that's it! The final scatter plot will show the CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects in the samples.
