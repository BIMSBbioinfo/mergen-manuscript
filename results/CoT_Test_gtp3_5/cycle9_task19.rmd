prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To normalize the counts and create PCA plots for the samples, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Read the count table and annotation data
```
library("readxl")
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

Step 2: Normalize the counts using the appropriate method (e.g., TPM or DESeq2 normalization)
```
# Here, let's use the DESeq2 normalization method
library("DESeq2")
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table[, -1], colData = annotation_data, design = ~ 1)
dds_normalized <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
```

Step 3: Perform PCA analysis on the normalized counts and create the first PCA plot
```
# Perform PCA analysis
normalized_counts <- assay(dds_normalized)
pca <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Create the first PCA plot color coded by "group"
library("ggplot2")
df <- data.frame(PC1 = pca$x[,1], PC2 = pca$x[,2], group = annotation_data$group)
ggplot(df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "PCA plot - Color coded by Group")
```

Step 4: Create the second PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection"
```
# Create the second PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection"
df2 <- data.frame(PC1 = pca$x[,1], PC2 = pca$x[,2], LibrarySelection = annotation_data$LibrarySelection)
ggplot(df2, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "PCA plot - Color coded by LibrarySelection")
```

The above steps will read your count table and annotation data, normalize the counts using DESeq2, and create two PCA plots for the samples: one color coded by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection".
