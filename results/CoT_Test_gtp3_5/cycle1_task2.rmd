prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we need to read and analyze the "leukemiaExp.txt" file. We can use the `read.table()` function in R to read the file and then extract the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the dataset.

Here's the code to achieve this:

```
# Read the gene expression data from 'leukemiaExp.txt' file
expr_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Get the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns) in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(expr_data)
num_samples <- ncol(expr_data)

# Display the results
num_genes
num_samples
```

By running this code, you will get the number of genes and samples printed in the R console.
