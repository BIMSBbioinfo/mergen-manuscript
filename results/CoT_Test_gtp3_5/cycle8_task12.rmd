prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in each table, we can use the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package to read the count table from the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" file, and the `read.table()` function to read the annotation data from the "SRP021193.colData.tsv" file.

Here's how you can do it in R:

```
# Install and load the required packages

library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count the number of rows and columns in the count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Print the number of rows and columns in the count table
print(paste("The count table has", count_rows, "rows and", count_cols, "columns."))

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of rows and columns in the annotation data
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns in the annotation data
print(paste("The annotation data has", annotation_rows, "rows and", annotation_cols, "columns."))
```

In the code above, we first install and load the `readxl` package, which provides the `read_excel()` function for reading Excel files. We then use this function to read the count table from "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and store it in the `count_table` data frame.

We count the number of rows and columns in the count table using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions, and store the results in the variables `count_rows` and `count_cols`.

Similarly, we use the `read.table()` function to read the annotation data from "SRP021193.colData.tsv" and store it in the `annotation_data` data frame. We count the number of rows and columns in the annotation data using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions, and store the results in the variables `annotation_rows` and `annotation_cols`.

Finally, we print the number of rows and columns in both the count table and the annotation data using the `paste()` function and the `print()` function.
