prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and the annotation data, we can use the `read.xlsx()` function from the `openxlsx` package for reading the Excel file, and the `read.delim()` function for reading the TSV file.

Here's how you can count the number of rows and columns for each file:

```
# Load required packages
library(openxlsx)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)

# Count number of rows and columns in the count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Count number of rows and columns in the annotation data
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the results
cat("Count Table Rows:", count_rows, "Columns:", count_cols, "\n")
cat("Annotation Data Rows:", annotation_rows, "Columns:", annotation_cols)
```

Make sure to replace the file paths in the `read.xlsx()` and `read.delim()` functions with the actual paths to your files.
