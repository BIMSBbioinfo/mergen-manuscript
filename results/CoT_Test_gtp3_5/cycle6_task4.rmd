prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we need to read the count table file and count the number of columns and rows.

Here is the code to read the count table and calculate the number of genes and samples:

```
# Read the count table file
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Count the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

In this code, we assume that the first column contains the gene names, the last column contains gene length, and the rest of the columns are samples. Adjust the code accordingly if this assumption is incorrect.

Note: The code assumes that the count table file is in the current working directory. If it's located in a different directory, provide the full path to the file in the `read.table()` function.
