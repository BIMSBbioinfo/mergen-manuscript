prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, you can use the `merge()` function in R. Here are the steps to accomplish this:

Step 1: Read the count table and annotation data into R.

```
# Read count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheetName = "Sheet1")
# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

Step 2: Inspect the count table and annotation data to ensure they are read correctly.

```
# Print the first few rows of the count table
head(count_table)

# Print the first few rows of the annotation data
head(annotation_data)
```

Step 3: Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample IDs.

```
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = "Sample")
```

Step 4: Calculate the number of columns in the merged data.

```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
num_columns
```

This will give you the number of columns in the merged data, which represents the number of samples.

Complete code:

```
# Read count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheetName = "Sheet1")
# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Print the first few rows of the count table
head(count_table)

# Print the first few rows of the annotation data
head(annotation_data)

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = "Sample")

# Calculate the number of columns in the merged data
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
num_columns
```

Make sure to replace the file paths with the actual file locations on your system.
