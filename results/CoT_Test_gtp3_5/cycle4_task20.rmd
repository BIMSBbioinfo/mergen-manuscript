prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To accomplish this task, we'll need to perform a differential expression analysis to identify genes that are specific to each group in the annotation data. We'll then use the results of this analysis to perform a PCA and color code the plot by the "group" variable.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Load the required libraries for data manipulation and analysis:

```
library(DESeq2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data:

```
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE)

annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

3. Prepare the count table for DESeq2 analysis:

```
# Set the row names of the count table to be the gene names
rownames(count_table) <- count_table[,1]

# Remove the first column (gene names) from the count table
count_table <- count_table[,-1]

# Convert the count table to a DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table, colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~ group)
```

4. Perform the differential expression analysis:

```
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Get the results of the differential expression analysis
de_results <- results(dds)

# Filter for genes that are significantly differentially expressed (adjust the threshold as needed)
sig_genes <- subset(de_results, padj < 0.05)

# Separate the significant genes by group
group_specific_genes <- split(sig_genes, de_results$group)
```

5. Prepare the data for PCA:

```
# Get the expression values for the group-specific genes
group_specific_expr <- count_table[rownames(count_table) %in% sig_genes$gene, ]

# Perform log transformation and variance stabilization
group_specific_expr <- rlogTransformation(group_specific_expr)

# Transpose the expression matrix and add sample group information
pca_data <- data.frame(t(assay(group_specific_expr)), group = colData(group_specific_expr)$group)
```

6. Perform PCA and plot the results:

```
# Perform PCA
pca <- prcomp(pca_data[, -ncol(pca_data)], scale = TRUE)

# Get the first two principal components
pca_scores <- as.data.frame(pca$x[, 1:2])

# Add the group information
pca_scores$group <- pca_data$group

# Plot PCA with color coded groups
pca_plot <- ggplot(pca_scores, aes(PC1, PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot", x = "PC1", y = "PC2")

print(pca_plot)
```

That's it! This code will perform a differential expression analysis to identify genes specific to each group, and then plot a PCA using only those genes, with color coding based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.
