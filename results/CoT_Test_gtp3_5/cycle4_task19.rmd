prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To start, let's load the necessary libraries and read in the count table and annotation data.

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
library(pcaMethods)

# Read in count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read in annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Next, let's normalize the counts using the DESeq2 package. We will use the "group" column from the annotation data for normalization.

```
# Set column names of count table as rownames
rownames(count_table) <- count_table$gene_names
count_table <- count_table[, -1]

# Convert count table to DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table,
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~ group)

# Perform normalization using DESeq2
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Extract the normalized counts
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
```

Now, let's perform PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on the normalized counts and create two PCA plots, one color coded by "group" and the other by "LibrarySelection" in the annotation data.

```
# Perform PCA on normalized counts
pca_result <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts), center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)

# Extract PC scores
pc_scores <- pca_result$x

# Add annotation data to PC scores
pc_scores$group <- annotation_data$group
pc_scores$library_selection <- annotation_data$LibrarySelection

# Create PCA plot color coded by "group"
p1 <- ggplot(pc_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  xlab("PC1") +
  ylab("PC2") +
  ggtitle("PCA Plot (Color Coded by 'group')")

# Create PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection"
p2 <- ggplot(pc_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = library_selection)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  xlab("PC1") +
  ylab("PC2") +
  ggtitle("PCA Plot (Color Coded by 'LibrarySelection')")

# Display the PCA plots
p1
p2
```

Please note that in order to run this code successfully, you will need to have the necessary packages (`readxl`, `dplyr`, `DESeq2`, `ggplot2`, and `pcaMethods`) installed in your R environment.
