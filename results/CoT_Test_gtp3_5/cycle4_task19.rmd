prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Load the necessary libraries and import the data.
2. Normalize the count data.
3. Perform principal component analysis (PCA) using the normalized data.
4. Create two PCA plots, one color-coded by "group" and the other color-coded by "LibrarySelection".

Here's the code to accomplish these steps:

```
# Step 1: Load libraries and import data
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Step 2: Normalize count data using DESeq2 method
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table[, -1],
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~ 1)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Step 3: Perform PCA analysis using normalized counts
pca <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Step 4: Create PCA plots
# Color-coded by "group"
group_colors <- c("Control" = "red", "Treatment" = "blue")
group_labels <- annotation_data$group
pca_plot_group <- ggplot(data = as.data.frame(pca$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group_labels)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = group_colors) +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", color = "Group") +
  ggtitle("PCA Plot - Color-coded by Group")

# Color-coded by "LibrarySelection"
lib_sel_colors <- c("PolyA" = "green", "Random" = "orange")
lib_sel_labels <- annotation_data$LibrarySelection
pca_plot_lib_sel <- ggplot(data = as.data.frame(pca$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = lib_sel_labels)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = lib_sel_colors) +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", color = "Library Selection") +
  ggtitle("PCA Plot - Color-coded by Library Selection")

# Display the PCA plots
pca_plot_group
pca_plot_lib_sel
```

Please note that you need to have the necessary libraries installed (`DESeq2`, `ggplot2`, `readxl`) to run this code successfully. Additionally, make sure that the file paths provided (`Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx` and `SRP021193.colData.tsv`) are correct.

These steps will load the count table and annotation data, normalize the count data using DESeq2, perform PCA analysis, and create two PCA plots color-coded by "group" and "LibrarySelection" respectively.
