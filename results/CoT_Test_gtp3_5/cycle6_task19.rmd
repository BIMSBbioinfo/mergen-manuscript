prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will need to use the R programming language and the Bioconductor package. 

First, let's load the required libraries: `readxl` for reading Excel files, `DESeq2` for normalizing counts, and `ggplot2` for creating plots.

```
library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
```

Next, we will read the count table and the annotation data.

```
# Read count table
count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

Now, we will perform count normalization using DESeq2.

```
# Extract sample names from count table
sample_names <- colnames(count_data)[-1]

# Create DESeq2 object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_data,
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~1)

# Perform count normalization
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

To create the PCA plots, we will first extract the normalized counts from the DESeq2 object.

```
# Extract normalized counts
norm_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
```

For the first PCA plot, we will color code the samples by the "group" column in the annotation data. We will perform PCA on the transposed normalized count matrix to have samples as rows and genes as columns.

```
# Perform PCA on transposed normalized count matrix
pca_data <- prcomp(t(norm_counts))

# Create first PCA plot
ggplot(data = annotation_data, aes(x = pca_data$x[,1], y = pca_data$x[,2], color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA Plot - Group")
```

For the second PCA plot, we will color code the samples by the "LibrarySelection" column in the annotation data.

```
# Create second PCA plot
ggplot(data = annotation_data, aes(x = pca_data$x[,1], y = pca_data$x[,2], color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA Plot - Library Selection")
```

Here's the complete code:

```
library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Read count table
count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Extract sample names from count table
sample_names <- colnames(count_data)[-1]

# Create DESeq2 object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_data,
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~1)

# Perform count normalization
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Extract normalized counts
norm_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA on transposed normalized count matrix
pca_data <- prcomp(t(norm_counts))

# Create first PCA plot
ggplot(data = annotation_data, aes(x = pca_data$x[,1], y = pca_data$x[,2], color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA Plot - Group")

# Create second PCA plot
ggplot(data = annotation_data, aes(x = pca_data$x[,1], y = pca_data$x[,2], color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA Plot - Library Selection")
```

Please make sure to replace the file names with the correct paths to your files.
