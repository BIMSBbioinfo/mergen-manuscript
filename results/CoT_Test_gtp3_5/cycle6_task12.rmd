prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in a table using R, we can use the `dim()` function. To read the count table and annotation data, we can use the `read.table()` function. Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. Read the count table:
```
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE)
```

2. Read the annotation data:
```
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)
```

3. Count the number of rows and columns for the count table:
```
count_rows <- dim(count_table)[1]
count_columns <- dim(count_table)[2]
```

4. Count the number of rows and columns for the annotation data:
```
annotation_rows <- dim(annotation_data)[1]
annotation_columns <- dim(annotation_data)[2]
```

Finally, let's print the results:
```
cat("Count Table: Rows =", count_rows, ", Columns =", count_columns, "\n")
cat("Annotation Data: Rows =", annotation_rows, ", Columns =", annotation_columns, "\n")
```

The code above should provide the number of rows and columns for both the count table and the annotation data.
