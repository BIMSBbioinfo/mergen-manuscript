prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the data from the Excel file, and then count the number of rows and columns.

Here is the code to accomplish this task:
```
# Install and load the readxl package

library(readxl)

# Read the gene expression data from the Excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```

This code will read the gene expression data from the Excel file and store it in the `data` object. Then, using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions, we can determine the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the dataset. Finally, we print the results.

Please note that the code assumes that the Excel file is located in the current working directory. If it is located in a different directory, you should provide the full file path in the `read_excel()` function.
