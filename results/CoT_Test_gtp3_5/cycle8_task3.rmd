prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the gene expression data, we can use the R programming language and the `readxl` package to read the Excel file and obtain the dimensions of the dataset.

First, make sure you have the `readxl` package installed by running the following command:

```

```

Then, load the `readxl` package and read the Excel file using the `read_excel` function. Let's assume the Excel file is located in the current working directory.

```
library(readxl)
# Replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the correct file path if it's not in the current working directory
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

To obtain the number of genes and samples, we can use the `dim` function, which returns the dimensions of a matrix or data frame. The number of genes corresponds to the number of rows in the data, and the number of samples corresponds to the number of columns.

```
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data)

num_genes
num_samples
```

Here's an example of how the code would look when executed:

```
# Install the readxl package if not already installed


# Load the readxl package
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```

Please note that you need to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the correct file path or name if it's different from what was provided.
