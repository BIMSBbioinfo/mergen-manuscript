prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the gene expression count table and the sample annotation data, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the required packages:
```
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

2. Read the count table and sample annotation data:
```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)
```

3. Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample IDs:
```
merged_data <- inner_join(count_table, annotation_data, by = c("SampleID" = "Sample"))
```

4. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color-coded by the "group" variable in the annotation data:
```
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = gene_of_interest)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Gene Expression by Group")
```
Note: Replace "gene_of_interest" with the name of the specific gene you are interested in plotting.

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the correct file paths or names in your local directory. Also, modify the column names in the code according to your data.

This code will merge the count table and annotation data and plot boxplots of gene expression values per sample color-coded by group. Remember to replace "gene_of_interest" with the specific gene you want to plot.
