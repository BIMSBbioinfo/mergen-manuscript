prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, we will need to load both files and match the sample ids between the two datasets. Once merged, we can plot the boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code them based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Load the necessary packages:
```
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
```

2. Read the gene expression count table:
```
count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```
Note: Make sure the file path is correct.

3. Read the annotation data:
```
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```
Note: Make sure the file path is correct and adjust the read.delim() function parameters based on the format of your annotation file.

4. Match the sample ids between the two datasets:
```
merged_data <- merge(count_data, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = "sample_id", all.x = TRUE)
```
Note: Adjust the column names ("sample_id") based on the actual column name in your annotation data.

5. Plot the boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code them based on the "group" variable in the annotation data:
```
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = gene_name, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  theme_bw()
```
Note: Adjust the column names ("group", "gene_name") based on the actual column names in your annotation data and gene expression table.

This code will load the files, merge them based on sample ids, and generate a boxplot showing the gene expression values per sample, with color-coded boxplots based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.

Remember to adjust the file paths and column names based on your specific data.
