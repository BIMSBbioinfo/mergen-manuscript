prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, we can use the sample ids as the key to join the two tables. We can then calculate the number of columns by counting the number of columns in the merged table.

Here's the step-by-step solution using R:

1. Load the required packages and read the count table and annotation data:

```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

2. Merge the count table and annotation data using the sample ids:

```
# Merge count table and annotation data
merged_table <- inner_join(annotation_data, count_table, by = c("sample_id" = "Gene.names"))
```

Note: Replace "sample_id" with the actual column name in your annotation data that contains the sample ids. Replace "Gene.names" with the actual column name in your count table that contains the gene names.

3. Calculate the number of columns in the merged table:

```
# Calculate number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_table)
```

Now you have the number of columns in the merged table.

Full code:

```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Merge count table and annotation data
merged_table <- inner_join(annotation_data, count_table, by = c("sample_id" = "Gene.names"))

# Calculate number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_table)
```

Please make sure to replace the file names ("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv") with the actual file names and provide the correct column names for joining the tables.
