prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate the number of columns, we can use the following steps:

1. Load the required R packages: 

```
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data into R:

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)
```

3. Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample IDs:

```
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = "sample_id")
```

4. Calculate the number of columns in the merged data:

```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

Here's the complete code:

```
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# Read count table and annotation data
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Merge count table and annotation data
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = "sample_id")

# Calculate number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths in your system.
