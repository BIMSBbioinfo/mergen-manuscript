prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the gene expression dataset, we can use the pandas library in Python. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```python
   !pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   ```

3. Load the Excel file using the `read_excel()` function:
   ```python
   df = pd.read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
   ```

4. Get the number of genes and samples using the `shape` attribute:
   ```python
   num_genes = df.shape[0]
   num_samples = df.shape[1] - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the gene name column
   ```

5. Print the results:
   ```python
   print("Number of genes:", num_genes)
   print("Number of samples:", num_samples)
   ```

Putting it all together, here's the complete code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the Excel file
df = pd.read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes = df.shape[0]
num_samples = df.shape[1] - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the gene name column

# Print the results
print("Number of genes:", num_genes)
print("Number of samples:", num_samples)
```
