prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the R programming language and the `readxl` package to read the data from the Excel file. Then, we can use the built-in functions `nrow()` and `ncol()` to calculate the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the dataset, respectively.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install and load the readxl package

library(readxl)

# Set the file path to the Excel file
file_path <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"

# Read the data from the Excel file
gene_expression_data <- read_excel(file_path)

# Calculate the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expression_data)
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expression_data)

num_genes
num_samples
```

Please make sure you have installed the `readxl` package before running this code. The result will be displayed in the R console, showing the number of genes and samples in the dataset.

Note: The `read_excel()` function assumes that the data is stored in the first sheet of the Excel file. If the data is in a different sheet, you can specify the sheet name or index using the `sheet` argument of the function.
