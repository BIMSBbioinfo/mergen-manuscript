prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, you can use the "merge()" function in R. Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(openxlsx)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep="\t")

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = "sample_id", all.x = TRUE)

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code based on the group variable
boxplot_cols <- merged_data$group
boxplot_vals <- merged_data[, 2:ncol(merged_data)]  # Assuming gene expression values start from column 2

boxplot(boxplot_vals, col = boxplot_cols, main = "Gene Expression Boxplots", xlab = "Samples", ylab = "Expression Value")
```

Make sure to replace the file names with the correct paths to the files in your system. The result will be a boxplot showing the gene expression values per sample, with different colors representing different groups defined in the annotation data.
