prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To accomplish this task, we will follow these steps:

1. Read the gene expression data from "leukemiaExp.txt" into a data frame.
2. Calculate the variability of each gene.
3. Sort the genes based on their variability and select the top 1000 most variable genes.
4. Subset the data frame to only include the selected genes.
5. Create a heatmap of the gene expression data with clustering.
6. Perform PCA analysis on the samples and plot the resultant PCA plot.

Here's the code to accomplish these steps:

```
# Step 1: Read the gene expression data
expression_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Step 2: Calculate the variability of each gene
gene_variability <- apply(expression_data[, -1], 1, var) # Exclude the first column (gene names)

# Step 3: Sort and select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_var_genes <- head(order(gene_variability, decreasing = TRUE), 1000)

# Step 4: Subset the data frame to include only the selected genes
filtered_expression_data <- expression_data[c(1, top_var_genes + 1)] # Add 1 to include the first gene name column

# Step 5: Create a heatmap with clustering
heatmap_data <- as.matrix(filtered_expression_data[, -1]) # Exclude the first column (gene names)
heatmap(heatmap_data, Colv = NA, scale = "row", cexCol = 0.7)

# Step 6: Perform PCA analysis on the samples and plot the resultant PCA plot
pca <- prcomp(t(heatmap_data), scale. = TRUE)
biplot(pca)
```

This code will read the gene expression data from the file, calculate the variability of each gene, select the top 1000 variable genes, and create a heatmap with clustering based on these genes. It will also perform PCA analysis on the samples and plot a biplot representing the PCA results.
