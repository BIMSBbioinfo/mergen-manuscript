prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each, we can use the `read.table()` function in R. 

Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file and count number of rows and columns
met_table <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
num_rows_met <- nrow(met_table)
num_cols_met <- ncol(met_table)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file and count number of rows and columns
subjects_table <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)
num_rows_subjects <- nrow(subjects_table)
num_cols_subjects <- ncol(subjects_table)

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows in metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt:", num_rows_met, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt:", num_cols_met, "\n")
cat("Number of rows in subjects.txt:", num_rows_subjects, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in subjects.txt:", num_cols_subjects, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"` and `"subjects.txt"` with the actual file paths.

This code will read both tables and print the number of rows and columns for each table.
