prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the R programming language and its various bioinformatics libraries. Here's how we can do it step by step:

Step 1: Install and load the necessary packages
```
  # Package for reading Excel files
library(readxl)
```

Step 2: Read the Excel file and load the data into R
```
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

Step 3: Extract the number of genes and samples
```
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the gene names row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the gene names column
```

Step 4: Display the number of genes and samples
```
num_genes
num_samples
```

This code will read the Excel file and calculate the number of genes and samples in the dataset. Note that we subtract 1 from the row and column counts since the first row contains gene names and the first column contains sample names. The resulting values will be stored in the variables `num_genes` and `num_samples` respectively, and will be displayed as the output.
