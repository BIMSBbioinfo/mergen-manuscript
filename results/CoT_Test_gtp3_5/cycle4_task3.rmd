prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the data from the Excel file and then use the `dim()` function to get the dimensions of the dataset.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Install and load the `readxl` package using the following code:
```
 # Install the package
library(readxl) # Load the package
```

2. Read the Excel file and store the data in a variable:
```
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

3. Use the `dim()` function to get the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the dataset:
```
genes <- dim(data)[1]
samples <- dim(data)[2]
```

4. Display the number of genes and samples:
```
genes
samples
```

Final code:
```
 # Install the package
library(readxl) # Load the package

data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
genes <- dim(data)[1]
samples <- dim(data)[2]

genes
samples
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the correct file path or provide the file in the working directory of R.

Note: This solution assumes that the first row in the Excel file contains the column headers and not gene names. If the gene names are in the first row, you can subtract 1 from the number of genes calculation (`genes <- dim(data)[1] - 1`) to exclude the header row.
