prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns for each table, we can use the `read_excel` and `read.table` functions in R to read the count table and annotation data, respectively. We will then use the `dim` function to count the number of rows and columns for each table.

Here's the code to achieve this:

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Count number of rows and columns for the count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Count number of rows and columns for the annotation data
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the results
print(paste("Count Table - Rows:", count_rows, "Columns:", count_cols))
print(paste("Annotation Data - Rows:", annotation_rows, "Columns:", annotation_cols))
```

This code will read the count table from the file "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" using the `read_excel` function from the `readxl` library. Similarly, it will read the annotation data from the file "SRP021193.colData.tsv" using the `read.table` function, with the options `header = TRUE` to indicate that the first row contains column names, and `row.names = 1` to use the first column as row names.

The `dim` function is not used here because it returns the dimensions (rows and columns) as a single vector, whereas we want to print them separately.

The results will be printed, showing the number of rows and columns for both the count table and the annotation data.

Please make sure to adjust the file names and paths according to your specific file location.
