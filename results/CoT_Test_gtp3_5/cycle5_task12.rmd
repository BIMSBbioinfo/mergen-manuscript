prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in the count table ("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx") and the annotation table ("SRP021193.colData.tsv"), we can use the `read_excel()` and `read.delim()` functions from the "readxl" and "readr" packages respectively, and then use the `dim()` function to count the rows and columns.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load the required libraries
library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count the rows and columns in the count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Read the annotation table
annotation_table <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Count the rows and columns in the annotation table
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_table)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_table)

# Print the counts
cat("Count table:", count_rows, "rows and", count_cols, "columns\n")
cat("Annotation table:", annotation_rows, "rows and", annotation_cols, "columns\n")
```

This code reads the count table using the `read_excel()` function and stores it in the `count_table` variable. Then, it counts the number of rows using the `nrow()` function and the number of columns using the `ncol()` function.

Similarly, the code reads the annotation table using the `read.delim()` function and stores it in the `annotation_table` variable. Then, it counts the number of rows and columns using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions.

Finally, the code prints the counts for both tables using the `cat()` function.

Note: Make sure to install the "readxl" and "readr" packages if you haven't already done so, using the `install.packages()` function.
