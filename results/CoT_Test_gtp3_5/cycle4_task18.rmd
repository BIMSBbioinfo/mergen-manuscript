prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file to load the methylation data.
2. Read the "subjects.txt" file to load the subject information.
3. Merge the two datasets using the common "dbGap ID" column.
4. Filter the CpGs based on the criteria of being associated with Age but not with sex or Race.
5. Display the top 20 CpGs.

Here's the code to accomplish these steps:

```
# Step 1: Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# Step 2: Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects_info <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Step 3: Merge the datasets
merged_data <- merge(methylation_data, subjects_info, by.x = colnames(methylation_data)[1], by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Step 4: Filter the CpGs based on criteria
filtered_data <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$Age) & is.na(merged_data$sex) & is.na(merged_data$Race), ]

# Step 5: Display top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_data[, 1], 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

Please make sure to replace the file names and adjust the column names if necessary before running the code.
