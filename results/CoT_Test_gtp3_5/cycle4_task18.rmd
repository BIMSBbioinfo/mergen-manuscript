prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we can perform the following steps:

1. Read the data from the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file, which contains the CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual.
2. Read the data from the "subjects.txt" file, which contains information on the individuals, including their Age, sex, and Race.
3. Filter the CpGs based on the condition that they are associated with Age, but not with sex or Race.
4. Display the top 20 CpGs based on the filtered result.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
# Step 1: Read the CpG methylation data
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Step 2: Read the subject information data
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Step 3: Filter the CpGs based on the condition
age_cpgs <- metRmOl[, subjects$`dbGap ID`]  # Select columns corresponding to subject's dbGap ID (individuals)
sex_race_cpgs <- metRmOl[, !(colnames(metRmOl) %in% subjects$`dbGap ID`)]  # Select columns not corresponding to subject's dbGap ID (sex and race)

# Calculate mean methylation values for each CpG across individuals
age_mean <- colMeans(age_cpgs)
sex_race_mean <- colMeans(sex_race_cpgs)

# CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
cpgs_associated_with_age <- setdiff(names(age_mean), names(sex_race_mean))

# Step 4: Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(cpgs_associated_with_age, 20)
print(top_20_cpgs)
```

Please make sure to replace the file names `"metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"` and `"subjects.txt"` with the actual file names and adjust the file path if necessary.
