prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the count table file and count the number of columns (excluding the first and last column) for the samples and the number of rows for the genes.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
# Read the count table file
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = T, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Count the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Please make sure to replace "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" with the correct file path if it's different from the current working directory.
