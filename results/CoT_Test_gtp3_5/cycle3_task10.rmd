prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes cluster the samples, and extract cluster specific genes for each cluster.

response:
To filter genes based on their variability and retain the top 1000 most variable genes, we can calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) for each gene and sort them in descending order. The CV is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. Genes with higher CV values have greater variability.

Once we have the most variable genes, we can perform clustering on the samples using any suitable algorithm like hierarchical clustering or k-means clustering. After clustering, we can extract cluster-specific genes for each cluster by determining the genes that show the highest expression levels in each cluster compared to the other clusters.

Let's start by reading the gene expression data from the file "leukemiaExp.txt" and filtering the most variable top 1000 genes:

```
# Read the gene expression data
data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) for each gene
cv <- apply(data, 1, function(x) sd(x)/mean(x))

# Sort genes in descending order of CV
sorted_genes <- names(cv[order(cv, decreasing=TRUE)])

# Filter the top 1000 most variable genes
filtered_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000]
```

Now that we have the most variable genes, let's perform clustering on the samples using hierarchical clustering:

```
# Perform hierarchical clustering
dist_matrix <- dist(t(data[filtered_genes, ])) # Compute the distance matrix
clustering <- hclust(dist_matrix) # Perform hierarchical clustering

# Determine cluster assignments for each sample
cluster_assignments <- cutree(clustering, k=5)  # Assuming 5 clusters, you can adjust the value of k as needed
```

Finally, let's extract cluster-specific genes for each cluster:

```
# Create an empty list to store cluster-specific genes
cluster_specific_genes <- vector("list", max(cluster_assignments))

# Loop through each cluster and identify genes with highest expression in that cluster
for (cluster in unique(cluster_assignments)) {
  cluster_samples <- which(cluster_assignments == cluster) # Get samples belonging to the cluster
  
  # Find genes with highest expression in this cluster compared to other clusters
  max_expression <- apply(data[filtered_genes, cluster_samples], 1, max)
  
  # Store cluster-specific genes for this cluster
  cluster_specific_genes[[cluster]] <- names(max_expression[max_expression > quantile(max_expression, 0.9)]) # Adjust the quantile threshold as needed
}
```

Note: The above code assumes that the expression data is in a matrix format with gene names as row names and sample names as column names. Adjust the code accordingly if your data is in a different format. Additionally, the number of clusters (k) and the quantile threshold for selecting cluster-specific genes can be adjusted based on your specific requirements.
