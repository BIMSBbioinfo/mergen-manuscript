prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table and calculate the number of columns, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the count table and annotation data into R.
2. Rename the first column of the count table to match the sample ids in the annotation data.
3. Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample ids.
4. Calculate the number of columns in the merged dataset.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
# Step 1: Read the count table and annotation data
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1)
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Step 2: Rename the first column of the count table
colnames(count_table)[1] <- "sample_id"

# Step 3: Merge the count table and annotation data
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = "sample_id")

# Step 4: Calculate the number of columns in the merged dataset
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```

Make sure to replace the file paths with the actual paths to your count table and annotation data files.
