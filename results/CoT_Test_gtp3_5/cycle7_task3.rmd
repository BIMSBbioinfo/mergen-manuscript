prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package in R.

First, we need to install the `readxl` package if it is not already installed. You can install it by running the following command:

```

```

Once the package is installed, we can use the `read_excel()` function to read the data from the Excel file. We need to specify the file path and the sheet name (if there are multiple sheets in the file).

```
library(readxl)

# Specify the file path
file_path <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"

# Read the data from the Excel file
data <- read_excel(file_path)
```

Now, we can determine the number of genes and samples by using the `dim()` function, which returns the dimensions of the data frame.

```
# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- dim(data)[1] - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the gene names row
num_samples <- dim(data)[2] - 1

num_genes
num_samples
```

The above code will output the number of genes and samples in the dataset.
