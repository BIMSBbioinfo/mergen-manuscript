prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the R programming language and the `readxl` package to read the Excel file. Here are the steps to accomplish this:

Step 1: Install and load the `readxl` package (if not already installed).

```

library(readxl)
```

Step 2: Read the Excel file and store it in a variable (e.g., `data`).

```
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

Step 3: Use the `dim()` function to get the dimensions of the dataset.

```
genes <- dim(data)[1] - 1
samples <- dim(data)[2]
```

Explanation:
- In Step 3, we subtract 1 from the first dimension (`dim(data)[1]`) because the first row contains gene names.
- The first dimension gives the number of genes and the second dimension gives the number of samples.

Finally, let's put it all together and provide the code:

```

library(readxl)

data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

genes <- dim(data)[1] - 1
samples <- dim(data)[2]

genes  # Output the number of genes
samples  # Output the number of samples
```

Please make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the actual file path/name if it is different.
