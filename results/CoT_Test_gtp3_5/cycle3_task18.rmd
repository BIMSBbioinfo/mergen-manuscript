prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file containing the CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual into a dataframe.
2. Read the "subjects.txt" file containing information on the individuals into another dataframe.
3. Merge the two dataframes based on the matching dbGap ID and DBGapId columns.
4. Subset the merged dataframe to include only the columns of interest: CpG_id, Age, sex, and Race.
5. Select the CpGs where Age is not NA and sex and Race are NA.
6. Display the top 20 CpGs.

Here is the code to perform these steps:

```
# Step 1: Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Step 2: Read the "subjects.txt" file
individual_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Step 3: Merge the two dataframes
merged_data <- merge(individual_data, methylation_data, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "DBGapId")

# Step 4: Subset the merged dataframe to include only the columns of interest
subset_data <- merged_data[, c("CpG_id", "Age", "sex", "Race")]

# Step 5: Select CpGs where Age is not NA and sex and Race are NA
filtered_data <- subset_data[!is.na(subset_data$Age) & is.na(subset_data$sex) & is.na(subset_data$Race), ]

# Step 6: Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_data$CpG_id, 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

Please note that the code assumes that the files "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" are in the current working directory. If they are in a different directory, you will need to provide the appropriate file paths.
