prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, you can use the R packages `readxl` and `dplyr`. The `readxl` package will be used to read the excel files, and the `dplyr` package will be used to merge the data frames.

Here's the step-by-step solution to merge the annotation data and gene expression table and plot the boxplots:

1. Install and load the necessary packages:
```




library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data:
```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

3. Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample IDs:
```
merged_data <- inner_join(annotation_data, count_table, by = c("sample_id" = "Sample_ID"))
```

4. Plot the boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color-coded based on the "group" variable:
```
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = gene_name, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "blue", "green"))  # you can customize the colors here
```

Make sure to replace the file paths `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual file paths in your system.

Code block:
```




library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

merged_data <- inner_join(annotation_data, count_table, by = c("sample_id" = "Sample_ID"))

ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = gene_name, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "blue", "green"))  # you can customize the colors here
```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary packages (`readxl`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`) installed before running the code.
