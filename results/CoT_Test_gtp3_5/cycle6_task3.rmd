prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the R programming language and the `readxl` package to read the Excel file and then count the number of rows and columns.

First, make sure you have the `readxl` package installed by running the following code:

```

```

Next, load the `readxl` library by running:

```
library(readxl)
```

Now, use the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package to read the Excel file and store the data in a variable, let's say `gene_expression_data`:

```
gene_expression_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

To determine the number of genes, we can count the number of rows in the dataset using the `nrow()` function:

```
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expression_data)
```

To determine the number of samples, we can count the number of columns in the dataset using the `ncol()` function:

```
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expression_data)
```

Finally, we can print out the number of genes and samples using the `print()` function:

```
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

Here is the complete code:

```
# Install the readxl package if not already installed


# Load the readxl library
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
gene_expression_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Determine the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expression_data)
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expression_data)

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

Please make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the correct path to your Excel file.
