prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then extract the dimensions of the data frame.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
# Install and load the readxl package

library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file into a data frame
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Print the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data)

num_genes
num_samples
```

This code will read the Excel file "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" into a data frame called `data`. The number of genes is determined by the number of rows in the data frame (`nrow(data)`), and the number of samples is determined by the number of columns in the data frame (`ncol(data)`).

The code will print the number of genes and samples as the output.
