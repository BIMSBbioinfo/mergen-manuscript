prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file and store it as a table.
2. Read the "subjects.txt" file and store it as a table.
3. Merge the two tables based on the "dbGap ID" column to match the individuals.
4. Filter the merged table to include only the CpGs associated with Age.
5. Filter out the CpGs associated with sex or Race.
6. Display the top 20 CpGs.

Here's the code to accomplish these steps:

```
# Step 1: Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file and store it as a table
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Step 2: Read the "subjects.txt" file and store it as a table
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Step 3: Merge the two tables based on the "dbGap ID" column
merged_table <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "DBGapId", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Step 4: Filter the merged table to include only the CpGs associated with Age
age_related_cpgs <- merged_table[!is.na(merged_table$Age), ]

# Step 5: Filter out the CpGs associated with sex or Race
cpgs_filtered <- age_related_cpgs[is.na(age_related_cpgs$sex) & is.na(age_related_cpgs$Race), ]

# Step 6: Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(cpgs_filtered$CpG_id, n = 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

Note: Replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file names and make sure they are in the current working directory.
