prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can start by reading the count table file using R programming language. We will use the `read.table()` function to read the tab-separated values (TSV) file.

Here's the code to read the count table file and get the number of genes and samples:
```
# Set the file path to the count table
count_table_file <- "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv"

# Read the count table file
count_table <- read.table(count_table_file, header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2 # Subtract 2 to exclude the first and last columns

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" with the actual file path to your count table.

By running this code, you will get the number of genes and samples present in the dataset.
