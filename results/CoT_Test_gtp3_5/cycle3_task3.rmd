prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To find the number of genes and samples in the gene expression dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then extract the required information from the data.

Here's the step-by-step approach to solve the task:

1. Install and load the `readxl` package:
```
     # Install the package
library(readxl)                # Load the package
```

2. Read the Excel file and store the data in a variable:
```
dataset <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

3. Extract the number of genes and samples from the dataset:
```
num_genes <- nrow(dataset) - 1
num_samples <- ncol(dataset) - 1
```

Explanation:
- In step 2, we use the `read_excel` function from `readxl` package to read the Excel file and store the data in the `dataset` variable.
- In step 3, we calculate the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the total number of rows (`nrow(dataset)`) since the first row contains the gene names. Similarly, we calculate the number of samples by subtracting 1 from the total number of columns (`ncol(dataset)`) since the first column contains the gene names.

Finally, here's the complete code:
```
# Install and load the readxl package

library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
dataset <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Calculate the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(dataset) - 1
num_samples <- ncol(dataset) - 1

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```

This code will give you the total number of genes and samples in the dataset.
