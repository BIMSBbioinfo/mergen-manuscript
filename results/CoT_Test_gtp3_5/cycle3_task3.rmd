prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the gene expression dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then analyze the dimensions of the data.

First, make sure you have the `readxl` package installed by running the following command:

```

```

Once the package is installed, you can use the following code to read the Excel file and determine the number of genes and samples:

```
# Load the readxl package
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the dimensions of the data
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

This code will read the Excel file "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", determine the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the total number of rows (excluding the header row), and determine the number of samples by subtracting 1 from the total number of columns (excluding the first column). The results will be printed to the console.

Please note that you need to provide the correct file path to the `read_excel` function.
