prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To find genes specific for each "group" in the annotation data and plot a PCA using these genes, we will follow these steps:

1. Read the count table and annotation data.
2. Prepare the count table and annotation data for downstream analysis.
3. Perform statistical tests to identify group-specific genes.
4. Select the group-specific genes.
5. Perform PCA using the selected genes.
6. Plot the PCA with color-coded groups.

Please note that in order to execute the code, you will need to have the required R packages installed: `tidyverse`, `DESeq2`, `RColorBrewer`, and `ggplot2`.

Now let's go step by step:

Step 1: Read the count table and annotation data

```
# Load the required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(DESeq2)

# Read the count table
count_df <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_df <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

Step 2: Prepare the count table and annotation data

```
# Transpose the count table to have samples as rows and genes as columns
count_df <- count_df %>% pivot_longer(cols = -1, names_to = "Sample", values_to = "Count")

# Rename the gene name column in the count table
colnames(count_df)[1] <- "Gene"

# Convert the gene names to row names in the count table
count_df <- count_df %>% column_to_rownames("Gene")

# Remove any NA values in the count table
count_df <- count_df[complete.cases(count_df), ]

# Set the row names of the annotation data as sample ids
rownames(annotation_df) <- annotation_df$sample_id
```

Step 3: Perform statistical tests to identify group-specific genes

```
# Create the DESeqDataSet object for differential expression analysis
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_df, colData = annotation_df, design = ~ group)

# Run the differential expression analysis (here we are comparing each group to the rest)
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Perform statistical tests for each group
results <- lapply(levels(annotation_df$group), function(group) {
  res <- results(dds, contrast = c("group", group, "rest"))
  return(res)
})
```

Step 4: Select the group-specific genes

```
# Define a threshold for adjusted p-value (e.g., 0.05)
pvalue_threshold <- 0.05

# Get the group-specific genes for each group
specific_genes <- lapply(results, function(res) {
  sig_genes <- subset(res, padj <= pvalue_threshold)
  return(rownames(sig_genes))
})
```

Step 5: Perform PCA using the selected genes

```
# Select the count matrix for the group-specific genes for each sample
specific_counts <- lapply(specific_genes, function(genes) {
  count_df_specific <- count_df[genes, ]
  return(t(count_df_specific))
})

# Combine the count matrices for all groups
combined_counts <- do.call(rbind, specific_counts)

# Perform PCA on the combined count matrix
pca <- prcomp(t(combined_counts), scale = TRUE)
```

Step 6: Plot the PCA with color-coded groups

```
# Assign group labels to the PCA dimensions
pca_df <- data.frame(pca$x)
pca_df$group <- rep(levels(annotation_df$group), each = length(specific_genes[[1]]))

# Plot the PCA with color-coded groups
ggplot(pca_df, aes(PC1, PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This code will read the count table and annotation data, perform statistical tests to identify group-specific genes, select those genes, perform PCA using the group-specific genes, and plot the PCA with color-coded groups according to the annotation data.
