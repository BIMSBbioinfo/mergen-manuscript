prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the data and merge them into a single table using dbGapId information, return the number of columns.

response:
To solve this task, we will use the pandas library in Python. First, we'll read the data from the two files, then we'll merge the datasets based on the "dbGapID" column. Finally, we'll return the number of columns in the merged table.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the CpG methylation dataset
methylation_data = pd.read_csv('metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt', delimiter='\t')

# Read the subjects dataset
subjects_data = pd.read_csv('subjects.txt', delimiter='\t')

# Merge the datasets based on the dbGapID column
merged_data = pd.merge(methylation_data, subjects_data, left_on=methylation_data.columns[0], right_on=subjects_data.columns[1])

# Get the number of columns in the merged table
num_columns = len(merged_data.columns)

num_columns
```

This code reads the CpG methylation dataset and the subjects dataset using the `read_csv()` function from pandas. We then use the `merge()` function to merge the datasets based on the "dbGapID" column in the methylation dataset and the "dbGap ID" column in the subjects dataset.

Finally, we use the `len()` function to count the number of columns in the merged table and return the result.
