prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we need to merge the two datasets based on the "dbGap ID" column. Then, we can filter the merged dataset to include only the CpGs that are associated with Age but not with sex or Race. Finally, we can display the top 20 CpGs. 

Here's the step-by-step approach to accomplish this:

1. Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file and store it as a data frame.
2. Read the "subjects.txt" file and store it as a data frame.
3. Merge the two data frames based on the "dbGap ID" column.
4. Filter the merged data frame to include only the CpGs that are associated with Age but not with sex or Race.
5. Display the top 20 CpGs.

Here's the code:

```
# Step 1: Read "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Step 2: Read "subjects.txt" file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Step 3: Merge the two data frames based on "dbGap ID" column
merged_data <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Step 4: Filter the merged data frame to include only CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered_data <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$Age) & is.na(merged_data$sex) & is.na(merged_data$Race), ]

# Step 5: Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_data$CpG_id, 20)
print(top_20_cpgs)
```

Note: Replace the file names in the `read.table` function with the actual file names/path on your system.
