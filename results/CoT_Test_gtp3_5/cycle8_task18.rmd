prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we can use the following steps:

1. Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file, which contains the CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual.
2. Read the "subjects.txt" file, which contains information on the individuals, including their Age, sex, and Race.
3. Merge the two datasets based on the matching dbGap ID.
4. Filter the merged dataset to include only CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race.
5. Display the top 20 CpGs based on this filtering.

Here is the code to accomplish these steps:

```
# Step 1: Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Step 2: Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Step 3: Merge the datasets based on dbGap ID
mergedData <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGap ID", all.x = TRUE)

# Step 4: Filter the merged dataset
filteredData <- mergedData[!is.na(mergedData$Age) & is.na(mergedData$sex) & is.na(mergedData$Race), ]

# Step 5: Display the top 20 CpGs
top20CpGs <- head(filteredData[, -c(1, ncol(filteredData))], 20)
top20CpGs
```

Please make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file names or file paths in your system.
