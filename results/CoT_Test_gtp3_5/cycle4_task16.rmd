prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, you can use the merge() function in R. This function will match the rows based on common sample IDs and combine the information into a single data frame.

Here are the steps to accomplish this task:

1. Load the required packages:
```
library(readxl) # for reading Excel files
library(tidyverse) # for data manipulation and visualization
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data:
```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

3. Rename the first column of the count table to "gene" for easier merging:
```
colnames(count_table)[1] <- "gene"
```

4. Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample IDs:
```
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "gene", by.y = "sample_id", all.x = TRUE)
```

5. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on the "group" variable:
```
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression")
```

Here's the complete code to perform the merge and plot the boxplots:

```
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

colnames(count_table)[1] <- "gene"

merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "gene", by.y = "sample_id", all.x = TRUE)

ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression")
```

Make sure to replace the file names ("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv") with the actual file names and adjust any other data formatting or specifications as needed.
