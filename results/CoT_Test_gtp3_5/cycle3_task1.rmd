prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

response:
To find out the number of rows and columns in the "subjects.txt" file, we can use the `read.table()` function in R. Here's how you can do it:

```
# Read the file
data <- read.table("subjects.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Store the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_cols <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of rows and columns
print(paste("Number of rows:", num_rows))
print(paste("Number of columns:", num_cols))
```

Make sure to replace "subjects.txt" with the actual path or filename of your file. The `sep` argument specifies the separator used in the file (in this case, a tab), and the `header` argument is set to `TRUE` if the file has a header row.

Note: If the file is too big, you might want to consider using the `readr` package instead, which provides faster reading functions like `read_tsv()`.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
