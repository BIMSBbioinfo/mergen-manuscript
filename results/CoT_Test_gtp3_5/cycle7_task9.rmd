prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To filter genes based on their variability and retain the top 1000 most variable genes, we can calculate the variance for each gene across all samples. Then, we can sort the genes based on their variance and select the top 1000 genes.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Read the gene expression data from the file "leukemiaExp.txt" and store it in a data frame.

```
gene_expression <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

2. Calculate the variance for each gene across all samples.

```
gene_variance <- apply(gene_expression[, -1], 1, var)
```

Note that we exclude the first column (gene names) using `gene_expression[, -1]`.

3. Sort the genes based on their variance in descending order.

```
sorted_genes <- order(gene_variance, decreasing = TRUE)
```

4. Select the top 1000 genes with the highest variance.

```
top_genes <- gene_expression[sorted_genes[1:1000], ]
```

5. Plot a heatmap with clustering using the top variable genes.

```
library(gplots)

heatmap.2(as.matrix(top_genes[, -1]), main = "Gene Expression Heatmap", 
          trace = "none", col = colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(100))
```

This code uses the `heatmap.2` function from the `gplots` package to generate the heatmap. It converts the selected genes (excluding the first column) to a matrix using `as.matrix`.

6. Plot PCA for the samples using the top variable genes.

```
library(ggplot2)
library(ggfortify)

pca <- prcomp(t(top_genes[, -1]))

autoplot(pca, data = top_genes, colour = "Samples", shape = "Groups", 
         loadings = TRUE, loadings.colour = "blue")
```

This code uses the `prcomp` function from the base R package to perform PCA on the transposed matrix of the selected genes (excluding the first column). The `autoplot` function from the `ggfortify` package is used to visualize the PCA results.

Make sure to install the necessary packages (`gplots`, `ggplot2`, `ggfortify`) before running the code.
