prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

response:
Sure, I can help you with that. To determine the number of rows and columns in the tab-separated file "subjects.txt", we can use the read.delim() function in R. Here's the code:

```
# Read the file
data <- read.delim("subjects.txt", sep = "\t")

# Get the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_cols <- ncol(data)

# Print the results
num_rows
num_cols
```

Make sure to replace "subjects.txt" with the actual file path or name you have. 

Let me know if you need any further assistance or clarification.
