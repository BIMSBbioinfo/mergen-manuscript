prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To solve this task, we will need to use the `DESeq2` package in R for differential expression analysis and the `ggplot2` package for plotting the PCA. Here are the steps we will follow:

1. Load the necessary libraries and the count table and annotation data.
2. Prepare the count table and annotation data for analysis.
3. Perform differential expression analysis and identify group-specific genes.
4. Plot the PCA using the group-specific genes.

Let's write the code step by step:

Step 1: Load the libraries and data

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheetName = "Sheet1")

# Read the annotation data
annotation <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

Step 2: Prepare the count table and annotation data

```
# Set row names of count table as gene names
row.names(count_table) <- count_table[,1]

# Remove the first column (gene names) from the count table
count_table <- count_table[,-1]

# Extract the group information from the annotation data
group <- annotation$group
```

Step 3: Perform differential expression analysis and identify group-specific genes

```
# Convert the count table to a DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table,
                              colData = annotation,
                              design = ~1)

# Perform DESeq2 analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Extract the group-specific genes using a statistical test
result <- results(dds, contrast = c("group", "group1", "group2"))

# Filter genes based on adjusted p-value threshold (e.g., 0.05)
group_specific_genes <- subset(result, padj < 0.05)
```

Step 4: Plot the PCA using the group-specific genes

```
# Compute PCA using the group-specific genes
pca <- prcomp(t(assay(dds)[rownames(group_specific_genes),]))

# Create a data frame with the PCA results and group information
pca_df <- data.frame(PC1 = pca$x[,1],
                     PC2 = pca$x[,2],
                     Group = group)

# Plot the PCA colored by group
ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Group)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

By following these steps, you will be able to identify the group-specific genes and plot the PCA using the group information. Make sure to adjust the code according to the specific file names and column names in your data.
