prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in each table, you can use the `read.table()` function in R to read the tables and then use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions to count the rows and columns, respectively. Here is the code to accomplish this:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" table
met_table <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the "met_table"
met_rows <- nrow(met_table)
met_cols <- ncol(met_table)

# Read the "subjects.txt" table
subjects_table <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the "subjects_table"
subjects_rows <- nrow(subjects_table)
subjects_cols <- ncol(subjects_table)
```

The variables `met_rows` and `met_cols` will store the number of rows and columns in the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" table, respectively. Similarly, the variables `subjects_rows` and `subjects_cols` will store the number of rows and columns in the "subjects.txt" table, respectively.

Note: Make sure to replace the file names and paths with the actual file names and file paths where your tables are located. Also, specify the appropriate settings for the `header` parameter based on whether your tables have a header row or not.
