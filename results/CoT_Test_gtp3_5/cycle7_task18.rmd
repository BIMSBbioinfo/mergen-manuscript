prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file to get the CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual.
2. Read the "subjects.txt" file to get the information on the individuals.
3. Match the "dbGap ID" from "subjects.txt" with the first row of "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" to identify the individuals.
4. Filter the CpG methylation values based on Age but not on sex or Race.
5. Display the top 20 CpGs associated with Age.

Here is the code to accomplish this in R:

```
# Step 1: Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Step 2: Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Step 3: Match the "dbGap ID" to identify the individuals
matching_indices <- match(subjects$dbGap.ID, met_data[1,])

# Step 4: Filter CpG values based on Age but not on sex or Race
filtered_data <- met_data[, matching_indices]  # Keep only relevant columns
filtered_data <- filtered_data[c("CpG_id", "Age")]  # Keep only CpG_id and Age columns

# Step 5: Display top 20 CpGs associated with Age
top_20_cpgs <- head(arrange(filtered_data, desc(Age)), 20)
print(top_20_cpgs)
```

Please make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file paths or names in the code provided above.
