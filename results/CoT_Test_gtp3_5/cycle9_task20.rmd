prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To find genes specific for each "group" in your annotation data using statistical tests, you can perform differential expression analysis. This analysis will compare the expression levels of genes between different groups and identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed.

Here's a step-by-step approach to perform this analysis using R:

Step 1: Import the necessary libraries
```
library(DESeq2)
library(readxl)
library(tibble)
```

Step 2: Import the count table and annotation data
```
count_table <- as.matrix(read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"))
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

Step 3: Create a DESeqDataSet object
```
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table,
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~ group)
```

Step 4: Perform differential expression analysis
```
dds <- DESeq(dds)
res <- results(dds)
```

Step 5: Extract significantly differentially expressed genes
```
sign_genes <- subset(res, padj < 0.05)
```

Step 6: Filter genes specific for each group
```
group_specific_genes <- list()
groups <- levels(annotation_data$group)
for (group in groups) {
  group_annotations <- annotation_data$group == group
  group_res <- subset(sign_genes, group_annotations)
  group_specific_genes[[group]] <- rownames(group_res)
}
```

Now, you have a list `group_specific_genes` where each element contains the gene names that are specific to a particular group in your annotation data.

To plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable, follow these steps:

Step 1: Filter count table with "group" specific genes
```
group_specific_counts <- count_table[row.names(count_table) %in% unlist(group_specific_genes)]
```

Step 2: Compute PCA
```
pca <- prcomp(t(group_specific_counts))
```

Step 3: Create a data frame for PCA results
```
pca_df <- data.frame(PC1 = pca$x[, 1], PC2 = pca$x[, 2], group = annotation_data$group)
```

Step 4: Plot PCA
```
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(pca_df, aes(PC1, PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2")
```

This code will generate a PCA plot where the points are colored according to the "group" variable in your annotation data.

Please note that you may need to install the required R packages (`DESeq2`, `readxl`, `tibble`, and `ggplot2`) if you haven't already done so. You can use the `install.packages()` function to install these packages.
