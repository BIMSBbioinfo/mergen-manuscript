prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in the count table and annotation data, we will use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and the `data.table` package to perform the counting. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Install and load the required packages:

```



library(readxl)
library(data.table)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data:

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- fread("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

3. Count the number of rows and columns in the count table:

```
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)
```

4. Count the number of rows and columns in the annotation data:

```
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)
```

5. Print the results:

```
count_rows
count_cols

annotation_rows
annotation_cols
```

The above code will give you the number of rows and columns in both the count table and annotation data. Make sure to replace the file paths in the `read_excel` and `fread` functions with the actual paths to your files.
