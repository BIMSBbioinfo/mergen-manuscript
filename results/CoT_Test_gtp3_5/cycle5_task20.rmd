prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To accomplish the task, we can follow these steps:

1. Read in the count table and annotation data.
2. Perform statistical tests to find genes specific for each group.
3. Extract the count data for the specific genes.
4. Plot the PCA using the extracted count data and color code by group.

Let's start by reading in the count table and annotation data using code:

```
# Load required libraries
library(openxlsx)

# Read in count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)

# Read in annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

Now, let's perform statistical tests to identify genes specific for each group. We can use a t-test or any other appropriate statistical test based on the distribution of the data. Here, I will use the t-test as an example:

```
# Prepare empty list to store specific genes for each group
specific_genes <- list()

# Iterate over each group in the annotation data
for (group in unique(annotation_data$group)) {
  # Get the count data for the samples in the current group
  group_samples <- annotation_data$sample_id[annotation_data$group == group]
  group_count_data <- count_table[, group_samples]
  
  # Perform statistical test (t-test) for each gene between the current group and all other samples
  p_values <- apply(group_count_data, 1, function(counts) t.test(counts ~ annotation_data$group)$p.value)
  
  # Select genes with a significant difference (e.g., p-value <= 0.05) in expression between groups
  specific_genes[[group]] <- rownames(count_table)[p_values <= 0.05]
}
```

After identifying the genes specific for each group, we can extract the count data for these genes:

```
# Extract count data for specific genes
specific_count_data <- count_table[specific_genes[[1]], ]
```

Finally, we can plot the PCA using the extracted count data and color code by the "group" variable in the annotation data:

```
# Load required libraries
library("PCAtools")

# Perform PCA on the specific count data
pca <- prcomp(t(specific_count_data))

# Plot PCA with color-coded groups
PCAPlot(pca, metadata = annotation_data, color_by = "group")
```

Note: Please make sure to replace the file paths in the code with the correct paths to your data files.
