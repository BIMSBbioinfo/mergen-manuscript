prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To perform the analysis described, we will need to read in the count table, the annotation data, perform statistical tests to identify group-specific genes, and then plot a PCA using the group-specific genes and color code the PCA by the group variable. Let's go step by step.

Step 1: Read in the count table and annotation data

```
library(openxlsx)

# Read in the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)

# Read in the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

Step 2: Perform statistical tests to identify group-specific genes

To identify group-specific genes, we can use a statistical test such as the t-test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Here, we will use the t-test as an example.

```
# Create a function to perform the t-test for each group
group_specific_genes <- function(group_name) {
  # Subset the count table and annotation data for the specific group
  group_counts <- count_table[, annotation_data$group == group_name]
  
  # Perform the t-test for each gene
  p_values <- apply(group_counts, 1, function(counts) {
    t.test(counts[group_name], counts[!group_name])$p.value
  })
  
  # Adjust the p-values for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
  adjusted_p_values <- p.adjust(p_values, method = "BH")
  
  # Select genes with adjusted p-values below a certain threshold (e.g., 0.05)
  group_specific <- rownames(count_table)[adjusted_p_values < 0.05]
  
  return(group_specific)
}

# Apply the function to each group in the annotation data
groups <- unique(annotation_data$group)
group_specific_genes <- lapply(groups, group_specific_genes)
names(group_specific_genes) <- groups
```

Step 3: Plot PCA using group-specific genes and color code by group variable

To plot the PCA using the group-specific genes and color code by the group variable, we will use the `prcomp` function to perform PCA and the `ggplot2` package for visualization.

```
library(ggplot2)

# Subset the count table to include only the group-specific genes
group_specific_counts <- count_table[group_specific_genes$group1, ]

# Perform PCA
pca <- prcomp(t(group_specific_counts))

# Create a data frame with the PCA scores and group variable
pca_data <- data.frame(PC1 = pca$x[, 1], PC2 = pca$x[, 2], Group = annotation_data$group)

# Plot PCA with color coding by group variable
ggplot(pca_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", color = "Group")
```

Please note that the code provided assumes that the count table and annotation data are in the working directory. Adjust the file paths accordingly if they are in a different location. Also, make sure to install and load the required packages if you haven't already (`openxlsx`, `ggplot2`).
