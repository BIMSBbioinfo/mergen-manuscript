prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, we can use the `merge()` function in R. We will merge based on the common column, which is the sample IDs. Here's the code to do that:

```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Merge the two tables based on sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = "row.names")

# Remove the redundant row names column from the merge
rownames(merged_data) <- merged_data$Row.names
merged_data <- merged_data[, -1]
```

Now, let's plot the boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code them based on the "group" variable in the annotation data. We can use the `ggplot2` package in R for this task. Here's the code:

```
# Install and load the ggplot2 package

library(ggplot2)

# Plot boxplots with color-coded groups
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = gene_name, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Gene Expression by Group")
```

Please note that the code assumes that the "group" variable in your annotation data represents the groups you want to color code the boxplots by. You may need to modify the code accordingly if your annotation data has a different column name for the groups.
