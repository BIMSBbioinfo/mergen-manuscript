prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables and plot the boxplots, you can follow these steps:

1. Read the count table and annotation data into R.
2. Merge the two tables based on the matching sample IDs.
3. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color-coded based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.

Here's the code to accomplish the task:

```
# Step 1: Read the count table and annotation data
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE)
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Step 2: Merge the two tables based on sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = 1, all = TRUE)

# Step 3: Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color-coded by "group"
boxplot_values <- merged_data[, 2:ncol(merged_data)]
boxplot_groups <- merged_data$group

boxplot(boxplot_values, col = boxplot_groups, xlab = "Samples", ylab = "Gene Expression", 
        main = "Gene Expression Boxplots per Sample", names = merged_data$GeneName)
```

Make sure to replace the file names `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the correct file paths for your system.

This code will read the count table and annotation data into R, merge them based on the sample IDs, and then plot boxplots of gene expression values per sample, with the boxplots color-coded based on the "group" variable in the annotation data. The x-axis will represent the sample IDs, and the y-axis will represent the gene expression values. The title of the plot will be "Gene Expression Boxplots per Sample" and the x-axis labels will be the gene names from the merged data.
