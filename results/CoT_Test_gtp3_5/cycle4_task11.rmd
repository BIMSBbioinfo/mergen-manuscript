prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read and analyze the datasets, we can use the `read.table()` function in R. 

Here's the code to read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file and count the number of rows and columns:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns
num_rows_met <- nrow(met_data)
num_cols_met <- ncol(met_data)

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of rows in met_data:", num_rows_met))
print(paste("Number of columns in met_data:", num_cols_met))
```

Similarly, here's the code to read the "subjects.txt" file and count the number of rows and columns:

```
# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns
num_rows_subject <- nrow(subject_data)
num_cols_subject <- ncol(subject_data)

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of rows in subject_data:", num_rows_subject))
print(paste("Number of columns in subject_data:", num_cols_subject))
```

Note: Make sure that both files are in the current working directory or provide the full path to the files in the `read.table()` function.
