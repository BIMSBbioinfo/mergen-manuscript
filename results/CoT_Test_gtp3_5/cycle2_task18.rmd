prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we will perform the following steps:

1. Load the data from the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file, which contains the CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual.
2. Load the data from the "subjects.txt" file, which contains information on the individuals, including their Age, sex, and Race.
3. Subset the CpG methylation data to include only the columns (individuals) with matching dbGap IDs in the subjects data.
4. Calculate the correlation between the CpG methylation values and Age for each CpG.
5. Filter out any CpGs that are also correlated with sex or Race.
6. Sort the CpGs by their correlation coefficient with Age in descending order.
7. Display the top 20 CpGs.

Below is the code to accomplish these steps:

```
# Step 1: Load CpG methylation data
cpg_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header=TRUE, sep="\t")

# Step 2: Load subjects data
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header=TRUE, sep="\t")

# Step 3: Subset CpG methylation data to include only matching individuals
matching_columns <- intersect(colnames(cpg_data)[-1], subjects_data$`dbGap ID`)
selected_columns <- c("CpG_id", matching_columns)
subset_cpg_data <- cpg_data[selected_columns]

# Step 4: Calculate correlation between CpG methylation values and Age
correlations <- apply(subset_cpg_data[, -1], 2, function(x) cor(x, subjects_data$Age))

# Step 5: Filter CpGs not correlated with sex or Race
sex_correlation <- cor(subjects_data$sex, subjects_data$Age)
race_correlation <- cor(subjects_data$Race, subjects_data$Age)
filtered_cpgs <- subset_cpg_data[, -1][abs(correlations) > abs(sex_correlation) | abs(correlations) > abs(race_correlation)]

# Step 6: Sort CpGs by correlation coefficient with Age
sorted_cpgs <- sort(correlations, decreasing=TRUE)

# Step 7: Display top 20 CpGs
top_cpgs <- head(sorted_cpgs, 20)
print(top_cpgs)
```

Note: Make sure to update the file paths in the `read.table` function to match the actual file locations.
