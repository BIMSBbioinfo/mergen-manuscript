prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we will first need to load and merge the two datasets based on the DBGap ID. Then, we can calculate the correlation between age and each CpG value. Finally, we can filter out CpGs that also have a significant correlation with sex or race. Here's the step-by-step solution with code:

Step 1: Load the datasets
```
# Load the required libraries
library(data.table)

# Load the CpG methylation dataset
metRmOl <- fread("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt")

# Load the subject information dataset
subjects <- fread("subjects.txt")
```

Step 2: Merge the datasets based on DBGap ID
```
# Rename the first column of the metRmOl dataset to "dbGap ID"
names(metRmOl)[1] <- "dbGap ID"

# Merge the metRmOl and subjects datasets based on the "dbGap ID" column
merged_data <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by = "dbGap ID", all.x = TRUE)
```

Step 3: Calculate the correlation between age and each CpG
```
# Calculate the correlation between age and each CpG
correlation <- cor(merged_data$Age, merged_data[, -c(1:4)]) # Exclude the non-CpG columns

# Convert the correlation vector to absolute values
correlation <- abs(correlation)
```

Step 4: Filter out CpGs associated with sex or race
```
# Check if any CpGs are significantly correlated with sex or race
sex_cor <- abs(cor(merged_data$sex, merged_data[, -c(1:4)]))
race_cor <- abs(cor(merged_data$Race, merged_data[, -c(1:4)]))

# Get the CpGs that are associated with age but not with sex or race
top_cpgs <- names(correlation)[correlation >= 0.7 & sex_cor < 0.7 & race_cor < 0.7]

# Get the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(top_cpgs, 20)
```

Finally, we can display the top 20 CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race:
```
top_20_cpgs
```

Note: In the code above, we assumed a correlation threshold of 0.7 to consider a CpG as associated with Age, while not being significantly associated with sex or race. You can adjust this threshold as per your requirements.
