prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To accomplish this task, we will use the `DESeq2` package in R for count normalization and the `ggplot2` package for creating PCA plots. Here are the steps to complete the task:

Step 1: Install and load the required packages

```



library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
```

Step 2: Import the count table and annotation data

```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")
```

Step 3: Create a DESeqDataSet object

```
# Convert the count table to a matrix
count_matrix <- as.matrix(count_table)

# Create a DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_matrix, colData = annotation_data, design = ~ 1)
```

Step 4: Normalize the counts using DESeq2

```
# Perform normalization using DESeq2
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

Step 5: Extract normalized counts

```
# Extract normalized counts
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
```

Step 6: Perform PCA analysis

```
# Perform PCA on the normalized counts
pca_data <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Extract PC scores
pc_scores <- as.data.frame(pca_data$x)
```

Step 7: Create PCA plot color-coded by "group"

```
# Add "group" information from annotation data to PC scores
pc_scores$group <- annotation_data$group[rownames(pc_scores)]

# Create PCA plot color-coded by "group"
pca_plot_group <- ggplot(pc_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Color-coded by Group")

# Display the PCA plot
pca_plot_group
```

Step 8: Create PCA plot color-coded by "LibrarySelection"

```
# Add "LibrarySelection" information from annotation data to PC scores
pc_scores$LibrarySelection <- annotation_data$LibrarySelection[rownames(pc_scores)]

# Create PCA plot color-coded by "LibrarySelection"
pca_plot_library <- ggplot(pc_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Color-coded by LibrarySelection")

# Display the PCA plot
pca_plot_library
```

And here's the complete code block for all the steps above:

```
# Install and load the required packages


library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# Convert the count table to a matrix
count_matrix <- as.matrix(count_table)

# Create a DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_matrix, colData = annotation_data, design = ~ 1)

# Perform normalization using DESeq2
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Extract normalized counts
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA on the normalized counts
pca_data <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Extract PC scores
pc_scores <- as.data.frame(pca_data$x)

# Add "group" information from annotation data to PC scores
pc_scores$group <- annotation_data$group[rownames(pc_scores)]

# Create PCA plot color-coded by "group"
pca_plot_group <- ggplot(pc_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Color-coded by Group")

# Display the PCA plot
pca_plot_group

# Add "LibrarySelection" information from annotation data to PC scores
pc_scores$LibrarySelection <- annotation_data$LibrarySelection[rownames(pc_scores)]

# Create PCA plot color-coded by "LibrarySelection"
pca_plot_library <- ggplot(pc_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Color-coded by LibrarySelection")

# Display the PCA plot
pca_plot_library
```

Please make sure to replace the file paths "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths on your system.
