prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in each table, we first need to load the required packages and read the data from the files. Then, we can use the `dim()` function to count the rows and columns.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load required packages
library(openxlsx)

# Read count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Count the number of rows and columns in the count table
count_rows <- dim(count_table)[1]
count_columns <- dim(count_table)[2]

# Count the number of rows and columns in the annotation data
annotation_rows <- dim(annotation_data)[1]
annotation_columns <- dim(annotation_data)[2]

# Print the results
print(paste("Count table has", count_rows, "rows and", count_columns, "columns."))
print(paste("Annotation data has", annotation_rows, "rows and", annotation_columns, "columns."))
```

Make sure to replace the file paths (`"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"`) with the actual paths to your files.

This code will read the count table and annotation data, count the number of rows and columns in each table, and print the results indicating the number of rows and columns for each table.

Note: The `openxlsx` package is used to read the Excel file in this example. If you prefer using a different package or file format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
