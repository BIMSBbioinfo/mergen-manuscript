prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To complete this task, we will need to read the count table and annotation data, merge them based on the sample IDs, and then calculate the number of columns in the merged table. 

Here's how we can accomplish that in R:

1. Install and load the necessary packages:
```
 # for reading Excel files
 # for data manipulation
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data:
```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

3. Merge the annotation data and count table based on the sample IDs:
```
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_ids", by.y = "Sample")
```

4. Calculate the number of columns in the merged table:
```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

5. Print the number of columns:
```
num_columns
```

Here's the complete code:
```


library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_ids", by.y = "Sample")

num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

num_columns
```

Please make sure to update the file names and column names in the code according to your specific data.
