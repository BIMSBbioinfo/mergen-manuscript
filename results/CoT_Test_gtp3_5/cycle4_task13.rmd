prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table and calculate the number of columns, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Load the required libraries for reading and manipulating data.
Step 2: Read the count table and annotation data.
Step 3: Perform any necessary data cleaning or manipulation.
Step 4: Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample ids.
Step 5: Calculate the number of columns in the merged dataset.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
# Step 1: Load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Step 2: Read the count table and annotation data
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Step 3: No data cleaning or manipulation required in this example

# Step 4: Merge count table and annotation data based on sample ids
merged_data <- inner_join(annotation_data, count_table, by = c("SampleId" = "Row.names"))

# Step 5: Calculate the number of columns in the merged dataset
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
print(num_columns)
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths or URLs to the data files.

Note: The code assumes that the sample ids in the annotation data match the column names in the count table. Adjust the join condition (`by = c("SampleId" = "Row.names")`) if the column names differ.
