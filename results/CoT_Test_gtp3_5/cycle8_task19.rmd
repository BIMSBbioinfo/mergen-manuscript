prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To perform the task, we will use R programming language and the DESeq2 package for normalization. We will also use the ggplot2 package for creating the PCA plots.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install and load the necessary packages:
```



library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data into R:
```
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
annotation <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

3. Create a DESeq2 object using the count table:
```
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table[, -1], colData = annotation, design = ~ 1)
```

4. Perform normalization using DESeq2:
```
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

5. Extract normalized counts:
```
norm_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
```

6. Perform PCA analysis on the normalized counts:
```
pca_data <- prcomp(t(norm_counts))
```

7. Create the first PCA plot color coded by "group":
```
ggplot(data = annotation, aes(x = pca_data$x[,1], y = pca_data$x[,2], color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (color coded by group)")
```

8. Create the second PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection":
```
ggplot(data = annotation, aes(x = pca_data$x[,1], y = pca_data$x[,2], color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (color coded by LibrarySelection)")
```

The code provided above will read the count table and annotation data, perform normalization using DESeq2, and create two PCA plots - one color coded by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection".

Please note that this code assumes that the count table and annotation data files are in the same directory as the R script. You may need to modify the file paths if they are located elsewhere.
