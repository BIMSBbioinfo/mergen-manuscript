prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file containing the CpG methylation values.
2. Read the "subjects.txt" file containing information on individuals.
3. Merge the two datasets based on the DBGapId.
4. Calculate the correlation between CpG methylation values and Age.
5. Filter out CpGs that are not associated with sex or Race.
6. Display the top 20 CpGs based on the correlation with Age.

Here's the code to perform these steps:

```
# Step 1: Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# Step 2: Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Step 3: Merge the two datasets based on DBGapId
merged_data <- merge(methylation_data, subjects_data, by.x = "DBGapId", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Step 4: Calculate the correlation between CpG methylation values and Age
correlation <- cor(merged_data[,"Age"], merged_data[,-c(1:3)], use = "complete.obs")

# Step 5: Filter out CpGs associated with sex or Race
filtered_cpgs <- names(correlation)[which(!names(correlation) %in% c("Age", "sex", "Race"))]

# Step 6: Display the top 20 CpGs based on the correlation with Age
top_20_cpgs <- head(sort(correlation[filtered_cpgs], decreasing = TRUE), 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

This code will read the two datasets, merge them based on the DBGapId, calculate the correlation between CpG methylation values and Age, filter out CpGs associated with sex or Race, and display the top 20 CpGs based on the correlation with Age.
