prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in the count table and annotation data, we can use the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel files and the `dim()` function to count the number of rows and columns.

First, we need to install the `readxl` package if it is not already installed. Run the following code to install the package:

```

```

Once the package is installed, we can proceed with reading the count table and annotation data.

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("path/to/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read_excel("path/to/SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Count the number of rows and columns in the count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the annotation data
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows in count table:", count_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in count table:", count_cols, "\n\n")
cat("Number of rows in annotation data:", annotation_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in annotation data:", annotation_cols, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"path/to/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"path/to/SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual paths to your count table and annotation data files, respectively.

This code will read the count table and annotation data, and then calculate and print the number of rows and columns for each table.
