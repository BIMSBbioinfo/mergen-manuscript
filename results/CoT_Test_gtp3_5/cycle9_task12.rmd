prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in a table, we can use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions in R.

Here's the code to read the count table and calculate the number of rows and columns:

```
# Load the required libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count the number of rows and columns in the count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows in the count table:", count_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in the count table:", count_cols, "\n")
```

Now, let's read the annotation table and calculate its number of rows and columns:

```
# Read the annotation table
annotation_table <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of rows and columns in the annotation table
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_table)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_table)

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows in the annotation table:", annotation_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in the annotation table:", annotation_cols, "\n")
```

Please make sure to adjust the filename and file path accordingly to match your local setup.

Don't forget to install and load the required libraries before running the code. In this case, we are using the `readxl` package for reading Excel files.
