prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each, we can use the functions `read.table()` and `dim()`. The `read.table()` function is used to read tables from text files, and the `dim()` function returns the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of a matrix or data frame.

First, we read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file and count the number of rows and columns:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns
num_rows_met <- dim(met_data)[1]
num_cols_met <- dim(met_data)[2]
```

Next, we read the "subjects.txt" file and count the number of rows and columns:

```
# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns
num_rows_subject <- dim(subject_data)[1]
num_cols_subject <- dim(subject_data)[2]
```

Finally, we can print out the number of rows and columns for each dataset:

```
# Print the number of rows and columns for each dataset
cat("Number of rows and columns in 'metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt':", num_rows_met, "rows,", num_cols_met, "columns\n")
cat("Number of rows and columns in 'subjects.txt':", num_rows_subject, "rows,", num_cols_subject, "columns\n")
```

Note: Make sure to replace the file names and file paths in the `read.table()` function with the actual file names and paths in your system.
