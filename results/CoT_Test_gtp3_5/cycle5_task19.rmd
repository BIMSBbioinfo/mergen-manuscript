prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To perform the task, we can follow these steps:

1. Load the required libraries: We'll need the `tidyverse` package to handle data manipulation and visualization, and the `readxl` package to read the Excel file.

2. Read the count table: We'll read the count table file using the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package. We'll assign it to a variable called `count_table`.

3. Read the annotation data: We'll read the annotation data file using the `read.delim()` function. We'll assign it to a variable called `annotation_data`.

4. Normalize counts: We'll normalize the counts using the `voom()` function from the `limma` package. This function is commonly used for RNA-seq data normalization. We'll assign the normalized counts to a variable called `normalized_counts`.

5. Perform PCA analysis: We'll perform PCA analysis on the normalized counts using the `prcomp()` function. We'll assign the PCA results to a variable called `pca_results`.

6. Create PCA plots: We'll create two PCA plots using the `ggplot2` package. One plot will be color-coded by the "group" variable, and the other plot will be color-coded by the "LibrarySelection" variable. We'll use the `ggbiplot` package to create the biplot, which combines the PCA plot with loadings. We'll assign the plots to two variables: `pca_plot_group` and `pca_plot_library`.

7. Display the PCA plots: We'll use the `print()` function to display the PCA plots.

Here's the code that implements these steps:

```
# Step 1: Load the required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# Step 2: Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Step 3: Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Step 4: Normalize counts
normalized_counts <- voom(count_table)

# Step 5: Perform PCA analysis
pca_results <- prcomp(t(exprs(normalized_counts)))

# Step 6: Create PCA plots
library(ggplot2)
library(ggbiplot)

# Plot color-coded by "group"
pca_plot_group <- ggplot(annotation_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color-coded by group)")

# Plot color-coded by "LibrarySelection"
pca_plot_library <- ggplot(annotation_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color-coded by LibrarySelection)")

# Step 7: Display the PCA plots
print(pca_plot_group)
print(pca_plot_library)
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual file paths of your count table and annotation data files, respectively.
