prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the file and count the number of rows (excluding the header) to get the number of genes, and count the number of columns to get the number of samples. Here's how we can do it in R:

```
# Read the file
expression_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of rows and columns
num_genes <- nrow(expression_data)
num_samples <- ncol(expression_data)

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

Make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the correct file path if it's stored in a different directory.
