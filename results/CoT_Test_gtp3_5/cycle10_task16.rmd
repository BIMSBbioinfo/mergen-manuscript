prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and the gene expression table, we will need to perform the following steps:

1. Load the necessary libraries: `tidyverse` for data manipulation and plotting, and `readxl` for reading Excel files.
2. Read the gene expression table and the annotation data into R.
3. Transpose the gene expression table so that genes are in rows and samples are in columns.
4. Merge the transposed gene expression table with the annotation data based on the sample IDs.
5. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.

Here is the code to perform these steps:

```
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# Step 1: Load libraries

# Step 2: Read gene expression table and annotation data
gene_expression_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Step 3: Transpose gene expression table
gene_expression_table <- t(gene_expression_table)

# Step 4: Merge gene expression table with annotation data
merged_data <- merge(gene_expression_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = 1, all.x = TRUE)

# Step 5: Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample
merged_data %>%
  gather(sample, expression, -GeneName, -group) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample, y = expression, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Sample", y = "Expression", fill = "Group") +
  theme_classic()
```

Make sure to update the file paths in the `read_excel` and `read_tsv` functions to match the locations of your files on your local machine.
