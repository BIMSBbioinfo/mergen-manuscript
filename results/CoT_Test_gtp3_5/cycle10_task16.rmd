prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables and plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample with color-coded groups, you can follow these steps using R:

1. Load the necessary libraries
```
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

2. Read the count table (Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx) and the annotation data (SRP021193.colData.tsv)
```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

3. Merge the count table and annotation data based on sample identifiers
```
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = 1)
```

4. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample with color-coded groups
```
gene_names <- merged_data[, 1]
sample_names <- colnames(merged_data)[2:ncol(merged_data)]
boxplot_data <- merged_data[, 2:ncol(merged_data)]

boxplot(boxplot_data, col = merged_data$group, xlab = "Sample", ylab = "Gene Expression", names = sample_names)
```

Here, we assume that the "group" variable in the annotation data represents the different groups or categories for which you want to color code the boxplots. Adjust the column indices accordingly if the location of the gene names or sample names varies in your count table.

Please make sure that the count table and annotation data are in the correct format and have the same number of samples.
