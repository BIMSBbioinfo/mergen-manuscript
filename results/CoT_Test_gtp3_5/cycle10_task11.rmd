prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each, we can use the `read.table()` function in R along with the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions to count the rows and columns, respectively.

Here's the code:

```
# Read the first table containing methylation values
methylation_table <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the methylation table
num_rows_methylation <- nrow(methylation_table)
num_cols_methylation <- ncol(methylation_table)

# Read the second table containing individual information
individual_info <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the individual information table
num_rows_individual <- nrow(individual_info)
num_cols_individual <- ncol(individual_info)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
cat("Number of rows in methylation table:", num_rows_methylation, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in methylation table:", num_cols_methylation, "\n")
cat("Number of rows in individual information table:", num_rows_individual, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in individual information table:", num_cols_individual, "\n")
```

This code will read the two tables and then count the number of rows and columns in each table. The resulting counts will be printed as output.
