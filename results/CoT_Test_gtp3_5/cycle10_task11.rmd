prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in each dataset, we can use the `read.table()` function in R to read the datasets into data frames. We will then use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions to count the number of rows and columns in each data frame.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file into a data frame
met_df <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file into a data frame
subjects_df <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the met_df data frame
met_rows <- nrow(met_df)
met_cols <- ncol(met_df)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the subjects_df data frame
subjects_rows <- nrow(subjects_df)
subjects_cols <- ncol(subjects_df)

# Print the results
print(paste("met_df has", met_rows, "rows and", met_cols, "columns."))
print(paste("subjects_df has", subjects_rows, "rows and", subjects_cols, "columns."))
```

Make sure to replace `"metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"` and `"subjects.txt"` with the actual file names of your datasets.

The code will read the datasets into data frames and then count the number of rows and columns in each data frame. The results will be printed to the console.
