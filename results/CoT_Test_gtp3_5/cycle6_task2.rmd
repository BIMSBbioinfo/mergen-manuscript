prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the data from the file "leukemiaExp.txt" and calculate the dimensions of the data matrix.

Here's the code to perform these steps:

```
# Read the data from file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

This code reads the data from the file using `read.table()` function, assuming that the first row contains column names (header) and the columns are separated by tabs (`\t`). It then uses `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions to get the number of genes and samples, respectively. Finally, the code prints the results using `print()`.

Note: When running this code, make sure the file "leukemiaExp.txt" is in the current working directory of your R environment.
