prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the gene expression data file into R and then check the dimensions of the data frame.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
gene_exp <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Check the dimensions of the data frame
num_genes <- nrow(gene_exp)  # Number of genes
num_samples <- ncol(gene_exp)  # Number of samples

num_genes  # Print the number of genes
num_samples  # Print the number of samples
```

The variable `num_genes` will store the number of genes in the dataset, while `num_samples` will store the number of samples. The corresponding values will be printed at the end.
