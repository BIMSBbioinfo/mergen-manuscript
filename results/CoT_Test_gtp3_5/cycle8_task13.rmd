prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate the number of columns, you can use the following steps:

1. Load the required packages, such as `tidyverse` and `readxl`, to handle the data manipulation and read the files.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data into separate data frames.

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", delim = "\t")
```

3. Remove any unnecessary columns from the annotation data, leaving only the sample IDs.

```
annotation_data <- annotation_data %>%
  select(1)
```

4. Rename the column in the annotation data to match the column names in the count table.

```
colnames(annotation_data) <- colnames(count_table)[2:length(colnames(count_table))]
```

5. Perform an inner join between the count table and annotation data based on the matching sample IDs.

```
merged_data <- inner_join(count_table, annotation_data, by = "Sample_ID")
```

6. Calculate the number of columns in the merged data, excluding the gene names column.

```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data) - 1
```

7. Print the number of columns.

```
num_columns
```

Below is the complete code:

```
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", delim = "\t")

annotation_data <- annotation_data %>%
  select(1)

colnames(annotation_data) <- colnames(count_table)[2:length(colnames(count_table))]

merged_data <- inner_join(count_table, annotation_data, by = "Sample_ID")

num_columns <- ncol(merged_data) - 1

num_columns
```

Please make sure to replace the file names ("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv") with the actual file names and adjust the code as needed to match the structure and format of your files.
