prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and the gene expression table, we will use the sample IDs as the key to match the rows in both tables. We will then calculate the number of columns in the merged table. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Load the required libraries:
```
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

2. Read the count table from "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx":
```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

3. Read the annotation data from "SRP021193.colData.tsv":
```
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

4. Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample IDs:
```
merged_table <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = 1, all.x = TRUE)
```

5. Calculate the number of columns in the merged table:
```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_table)
```

6. Print the number of columns:
```
print(num_columns)
```

Here is the code block with all the steps together:
```
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

merged_table <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = 1, all.x = TRUE)

num_columns <- ncol(merged_table)

print(num_columns)
```

Please make sure to adjust the file paths if necessary.
