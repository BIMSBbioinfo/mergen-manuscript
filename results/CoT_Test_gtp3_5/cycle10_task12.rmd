prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns for each table, we can use the "read_excel" and "read.table" functions in R to read the count table and annotation data, respectively. Then, we can use the "dim" function to count the number of rows and columns.

Here is the code to achieve this:

```
# Load the necessary libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count the number of rows and columns in the count table
count_rows <- dim(count_table)[1]
count_cols <- dim(count_table)[2]

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the annotation data
annotation_rows <- dim(annotation_data)[1]
annotation_cols <- dim(annotation_data)[2]

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
cat("Count Table has", count_rows, "rows and", count_cols, "columns.\n")
cat("Annotation Data has", annotation_rows, "rows and", annotation_cols, "columns.\n")
```

This code reads the count table from the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" file using the "read_excel" function from the "readxl" library. It then counts the number of rows and columns using the "dim" function. Similarly, it reads the annotation data from the "SRP021193.colData.tsv" file using the "read.table" function and counts the number of rows and columns.

The results will be printed as the number of rows and columns for each table.
