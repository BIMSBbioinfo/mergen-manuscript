prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read and analyze the count table and annotation data in R, we can make use of the `read.xlsx` and `read.delim` functions respectively. Here's how we can perform the task:

1. Load the required libraries for reading Excel files and data manipulation in R:
```
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

2. Read the count table from the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" file and check the number of rows and columns:
```
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)
```

3. Read the annotation data from the "SRP021193.colData.tsv" file and check the number of rows and columns:
```
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
annot_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annot_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)
```

4. Print the number of rows and columns for both the count table and annotation data:
```
print(paste("Count Table: Rows =", count_rows, ", Columns =", count_cols))
print(paste("Annotation Data: Rows =", annot_rows, ", Columns =", annot_cols))
```

Putting it all together, the final code will look like this:

```
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
annot_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annot_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

print(paste("Count Table: Rows =", count_rows, ", Columns =", count_cols))
print(paste("Annotation Data: Rows =", annot_rows, ", Columns =", annot_cols))
```

Note: Make sure to replace the file paths "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual paths to your files.
