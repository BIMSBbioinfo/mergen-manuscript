prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To accomplish this task, we will follow these steps:

1. Read the gene expression data from the file "leukemiaExp.txt" into a matrix.
2. Calculate the variability of each gene in order to filter the top 1000 most variable genes.
3. Filter the gene expression matrix to retain only the top 1000 variable genes.
4. Perform hierarchical clustering on the variable genes and plot a heatmap.
5. Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the samples and plot the results.

Let's start by reading the gene expression data from the file:

```
# Step 1: Read gene expression data
gene_expr <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Display the first few rows of the gene expression data
head(gene_expr)
```

Next, we will calculate the variability of each gene:

```
# Step 2: Calculate gene variability
gene_variability <- apply(gene_expr, 1, var)

# Sort the genes based on variability in descending order
sorted_genes <- names(sort(gene_variability, decreasing = TRUE))

# Display the top 10 genes with highest variability
head(sorted_genes, 10)
```

Now, let's filter the gene expression matrix to retain only the top 1000 variable genes:

```
# Step 3: Filter gene expression matrix
filtered_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000]
filtered_gene_expr <- gene_expr[filtered_genes, ]

# Display the filtered gene expression matrix
head(filtered_gene_expr)
```

We will now perform hierarchical clustering on the variable genes and plot a heatmap:

```
# Step 4: Hierarchical clustering and heatmap
heatmap_data <- filtered_gene_expr
heatmap_clustered_data <- heatmap_data[rowMeans(heatmap_data) >= quantile(rowMeans(heatmap_data), 0.1), ]
heatmap_clusters <- hclust(dist(t(heatmap_clustered_data)))
heatmap_ordered_data <- heatmap_clustered_data[heatmap_clusters$order, ]

# Plot the heatmap
heatmap(heatmap_ordered_data, scale = "row", main = "Gene Expression Heatmap")
```

Finally, let's perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the samples and plot the results:

```
# Step 5: PCA on samples
pca_data <- t(filtered_gene_expr)
pca_result <- prcomp(pca_data, scale = TRUE)

# Plot the PCA results
plot(pca_result$x[, 1], pca_result$x[, 2], xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2", main = "PCA Plot")
```

By following these steps, you should now have a heatmap with clustering based on the top 1000 most variable genes, as well as a PCA plot for the samples.
