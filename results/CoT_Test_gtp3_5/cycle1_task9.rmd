prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To filter genes based on their variability and retain the top 1000 most variable genes, we can follow these steps in R:

Step 1: Read the gene expression data file into a data frame.

```
# Read the gene expression data file
expression_data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t")
```

Step 2: Remove the first column containing gene names.

```
# Remove the first column containing gene names
expression_data <- expression_data[, -1]
```

Step 3: Calculate the variance for each gene across samples and select the top 1000 genes with the highest variance.

```
# Calculate variance for each gene
gene_variances <- apply(expression_data, 1, var)

# Select top 1000 genes with highest variance
top_1000_genes <- names(sort(gene_variances, decreasing = TRUE))[1:1000]

# Filter expression data to retain only the top 1000 genes
filtered_expression_data <- expression_data[top_1000_genes, ]
```

Step 4: Plot a heatmap with clustering using the filtered expression data.

```
# Load required library
library(gplots)

# Plot heatmap with clustering
heatmap.2(as.matrix(filtered_expression_data), dendrogram = "row", scale = "row")
```

Step 5: Plot PCA for samples using the filtered expression data.

```
# Load required library
library(ggplot2)
library(ggfortify)

# Perform PCA on the filtered expression data
pca <- prcomp(t(filtered_expression_data), scale = TRUE)

# Plot PCA
autoplot(pca, data = expression_data, colour = "Sample_ID")
```

Please make sure to install the required R packages (gplots, ggplot2, ggfortify) before running the code. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
