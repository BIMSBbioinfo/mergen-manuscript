prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, you can follow these steps using R:

1. Read the count table and annotation data into R.

You can use the `read.table()` function to read both the count table and annotation data. Assuming the count table is in Excel format, you can use the `read.xlsx()` function from the `openxlsx` package to read it.
```
library(openxlsx)

count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1, header = TRUE)
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

2. Check the structure and dimensions of the count table and annotation data.

Use the `str()` function to check the structure of the data frames and the `dim()` function to check the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the data frames.
```
str(count_table)
dim(count_table)

str(annotation_data)
dim(annotation_data)
```

3. Perform a column-wise merge of the count table and annotation data based on sample IDs.

You can use the `merge()` function to perform the merge. Make sure the sample IDs column in the annotation data matches the column names in the count table. Assuming the sample IDs column in the annotation data is named "SampleID", and the column names in the count table are the sample IDs, you can merge them as follows:
```
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = "SampleID", all.x = TRUE)
```

4. Calculate the number of columns in the merged data.

You can use the `ncol()` function to calculate the number of columns in the merged data.
```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

Here is the complete code block:
```
library(openxlsx)

count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1, header = TRUE)
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

str(count_table)
dim(count_table)

str(annotation_data)
dim(annotation_data)

merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = "SampleID", all.x = TRUE)

num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

Make sure to replace the file paths with the actual paths to your count table and annotation data files.
