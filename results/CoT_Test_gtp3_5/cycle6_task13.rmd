prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and the gene expression table, we can use the sample ids as the common column to merge on. To do this, we'll use the `read_excel()` and `read.table()` functions from the `readxl` and `readr` packages, respectively. We'll also use the `merge()` function to merge the two tables based on the sample ids. Here's the step-by-step process:

Step 1: Install and load the required packages
```



library(readxl)
library(readr)
```

Step 2: Read the gene expression table
```
gene_exp <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

Step 3: Read the annotation data
```
annotation <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

Step 4: Merge the two tables based on sample ids
```
merged_data <- merge(annotation, gene_exp, by.x = "sample ids", by.y = "Sample")
```

Step 5: Calculate the number of columns
```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

Here's the complete code:

```
# Step 1: Install and load the required packages



library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Step 2: Read the gene expression table
gene_exp <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Step 3: Read the annotation data
annotation <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Step 4: Merge the two tables based on sample ids
merged_data <- merge(annotation, gene_exp, by.x = "sample ids", by.y = "Sample")

# Step 5: Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```
