prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the R programming language and the `readxl` package to read the data from the Excel sheet. Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. Install and load the `readxl` package:
```
  # Run this line only if the package is not already installed
library(readxl)
```

2. Read the data from the Excel sheet into a data frame:
```
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

3. Get the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns) in the dataset:
```
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data)
```

4. Print the number of genes and samples:
```
num_genes
num_samples
```

The final code would look like this:

```
# Install and load the readxl package
  # Run this line only if the package is not already installed
library(readxl)

# Read the data from the Excel sheet
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns) in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
num_genes
num_samples
```
