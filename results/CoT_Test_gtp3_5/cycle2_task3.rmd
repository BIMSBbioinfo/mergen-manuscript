prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then extract the relevant information.

Here's the step-by-step process to accomplish this:

1. Install and load the `readxl` package:
```
  # Install the package
library(readxl)             # Load the package
```

2. Read the Excel file and store it in a data frame:
```
# Replace "path_to_file" with the actual file path
data <- read_excel("path_to_file/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

3. Check the dimensions of the data frame to get the number of genes and samples:
```
num_genes <- nrow(data)         # Number of genes
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Number of samples (subtract 1 to exclude the gene name column)
```

4. Print the results:
```
num_genes
num_samples
```

By following these steps, we can determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset.

Please note that you will need to specify the actual file path when reading the Excel file.
