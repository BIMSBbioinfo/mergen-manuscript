prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables and count the number of rows and columns, we will use the `read.table()` function in R. Here is the code to perform this task:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the methylation data
num_rows_methylation <- nrow(methylation_data)
num_cols_methylation <- ncol(methylation_data)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the subjects data
num_rows_subjects <- nrow(subjects_data)
num_cols_subjects <- ncol(subjects_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
print(paste("Number of rows and columns in methylation data:", num_rows_methylation, "rows,", num_cols_methylation, "columns"))
print(paste("Number of rows and columns in subjects data:", num_rows_subjects, "rows,", num_cols_subjects, "columns"))
```

Note that you need to modify the file names ("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt") to match the actual file names in your directory.
