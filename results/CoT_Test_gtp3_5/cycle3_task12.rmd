prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data, we can use the read.table() function in R. 

First, let's read the count table "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and check the number of rows and columns:

```
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE)
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)
count_rows
count_cols
```

Next, let's read the annotation data "SRP021193.colData.tsv" and check the number of rows and columns:

```
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)
annotation_rows
annotation_cols
```

Note: We assume that the count table and annotation data are in the same directory as your R script or notebook.

By running these code snippets, you will get the number of rows and columns for both the count table and annotation data.
