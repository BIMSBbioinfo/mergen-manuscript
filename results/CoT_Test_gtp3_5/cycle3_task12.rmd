prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in each table, we can use the `readxl` and `readr` packages in R. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Install and load the necessary packages:

```



library(readxl)
library(readr)
```

2. Read the count table:

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

3. Count the number of rows and columns in the count table:

```
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

count_rows
count_cols
```

4. Read the annotation data:

```
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

5. Count the number of rows and columns in the annotation data:

```
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

annotation_rows
annotation_cols
```

Please make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the correct file paths on your system.

Here's the complete code:

```



library(readxl)
library(readr)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

count_rows
count_cols

annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

annotation_rows
annotation_cols
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
