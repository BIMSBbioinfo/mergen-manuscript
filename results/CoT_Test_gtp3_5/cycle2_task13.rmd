prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables in R, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the required libraries for reading and manipulating data:

```
library(tidyverse)  # for data manipulation
library(readxl)     # for reading Excel files
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data:

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

3. Check the structure and contents of both tables to ensure they were read correctly:

```
str(count_table)
head(count_table)

str(annotation_data)
head(annotation_data)
```

4. Based on the information you provided, it seems that the gene names are stored in the first column of the count table, and the sample IDs are stored in the first column of the annotation data. Therefore, we need to set these columns as row names in both tables to facilitate the merge:

```
# Set first column as row names in count table
row.names(count_table) <- count_table[, 1]
count_table <- count_table[, -1]   # Remove first column from count table

# Set first column as row names in annotation data
row.names(annotation_data) <- annotation_data[, 1]
annotation_data <- annotation_data[, -1]   # Remove first column from annotation data
```

5. Merge the tables using the row names as the matching keys:

```
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = "row.names", all = TRUE)
```

6. Calculate the number of columns in the merged data:

```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

7. Print the number of columns:

```
print(num_columns)
```

Here's the complete code:

```
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Checking the structure and contents of both tables
str(count_table)
head(count_table)

str(annotation_data)
head(annotation_data)

# Setting first column as row names
row.names(count_table) <- count_table[, 1]
count_table <- count_table[, -1]

row.names(annotation_data) <- annotation_data[, 1]
annotation_data <- annotation_data[, -1]

# Merging the tables
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = "row.names", all = TRUE)

# Calculating the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

print(num_columns)
```
