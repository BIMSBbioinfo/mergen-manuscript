prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Read and load the count table and annotation data
2. Normalize the count table
3. Perform PCA on the normalized count table
4. Create two PCA plots, one color-coded by "group" and the other color-coded by "LibrarySelection"

Let's start by reading and loading the count table and annotation data.

```
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Check the data
head(count_table)
head(annotation_data)
```

Next, we will normalize the count table using a suitable method. For simplicity, let's use the "TMM" (trimmed means of M-values) method from the `edgeR` package.

```
# Load required libraries
library(edgeR)

# Extract count matrix from the count table
counts <- count_table[, -1]

# Normalize count table using TMM method
normalized_counts <- calcNormFactors(counts, method = "TMM")

# Convert normalized counts back to a data frame
normalized_counts_df <- as.data.frame(normalized_counts)

# Add the gene names back to the normalized counts data frame
normalized_counts_df$Gene <- count_table$Gene

# Check the normalized counts
head(normalized_counts_df)
```

Now that we have the normalized counts, we can perform PCA analysis on the count table. We will use the `prcomp()` function from the base R package.

```
# Perform PCA on the normalized count table
pca <- prcomp(normalized_counts_df[, -ncol(normalized_counts_df)], scale. = TRUE)

# Extract the scores from the PCA output
pca_scores <- as.data.frame(pca$x)

# Add the sample ids from the annotation data to the PCA scores
pca_scores$Sample <- rownames(normalized_counts_df)

# Check the PCA scores
head(pca_scores)
```

Finally, we can create two PCA plots, one color-coded by "group" and the other color-coded by "LibrarySelection". We will use the `ggplot2` package for visualization.

```
# Load required library
library(ggplot2)

# Join the annotation data with the PCA scores based on the sample ids
pca_scores_annotated <- left_join(pca_scores, annotation_data, by = c("Sample" = "sample_id"))

# Plot PCA color-coded by "group"
pca_plot_group <- ggplot(pca_scores_annotated, aes(PC1, PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA plot (Color-coded by Group)")

# Plot PCA color-coded by "LibrarySelection"
pca_plot_library_selection <- ggplot(pca_scores_annotated, aes(PC1, PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA plot (Color-coded by LibrarySelection)")

# Display the plots
print(pca_plot_group)
print(pca_plot_library_selection)
```

And that's it! We have now normalized the counts, performed PCA, and created two PCA plots color-coded by "group" and "LibrarySelection". You can further customize the plots as per your requirements.

Please note that you might need to install the required R packages (`readxl`, `edgeR`, and `ggplot2`) if you haven't already done so. You can install them using the `install.packages()` function.
