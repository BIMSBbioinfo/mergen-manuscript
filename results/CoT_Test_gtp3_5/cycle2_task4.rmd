prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the count table file and count the number of columns (excluding the first and last columns) and rows in the file.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
# Read the count table file
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns)
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2  # Exclude the first and last columns

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" with the actual file path or the correct filename if it's in the same directory.

Please let me know if you need further assistance!
