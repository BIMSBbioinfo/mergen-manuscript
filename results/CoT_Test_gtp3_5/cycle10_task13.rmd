prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate the number of columns, you can follow these steps:

1. Read the count table from the Excel file using the "readxl" package in R.
2. Read the annotation data from the TSV file using the "readr" package in R.
3. Merge the two datasets based on the sample IDs.
4. Calculate the number of columns in the merged dataset.

Here's the code to achieve this:

```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Read the count table from the Excel file
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data from the TSV file
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "Gene", by.y = "Sample")

# Calculate the number of columns in the merged dataset
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
print(num_columns)
```

Make sure to adjust the file paths and column names in the code above based on your specific data.
