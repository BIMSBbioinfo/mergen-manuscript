prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the excel file and then count the number of rows and columns.

Here is the code to accomplish this:

```
# Install and load the 'readxl' package

library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of rows and columns in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtracting 1 as the first row contains gene names
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

This code will calculate the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the total number of rows, as the first row is assumed to contain the gene names. The number of samples is simply the total number of columns in the dataset.

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the appropriate file path if the excel file is not in the current working directory.

Note: Before running the code, make sure you have the `readxl` package installed by uncommenting the `` line if needed.
