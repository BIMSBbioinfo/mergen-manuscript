prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read and count the number of rows and columns in each dataset, you can use the following code:

```
# Read the tables
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count number of rows and columns in each dataset
metRmOl_rows <- nrow(metRmOl)
metRmOl_cols <- ncol(metRmOl)
subjects_rows <- nrow(subjects)
subjects_cols <- ncol(subjects)

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of rows in metRmOl:", metRmOl_rows))
print(paste("Number of columns in metRmOl:", metRmOl_cols))
print(paste("Number of rows in subjects:", subjects_rows))
print(paste("Number of columns in subjects:", subjects_cols))
```

This code reads the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" files using the `read.table()` function. It then counts the number of rows and columns in each dataset using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions. Finally, it prints the results using the `print()` function.

Make sure to replace `"metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"` and `"subjects.txt"` with the actual file names and paths in your system.
