prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the R programming language and its associated packages such as `readxl` to read the Excel file.

Here's the step-by-step approach to calculate the number of genes and samples:

1. Install the `readxl` package if it is not already installed:
```

```

2. Load the `readxl` package:
```
library(readxl)
```

3. Read the Excel file and store it in a variable:
```
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

4. Calculate the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the dataset:
```
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data)
```

5. Print the results:
```
num_genes
num_samples
```

By executing the above code, you will get the number of genes and samples present in the dataset.

Here's the complete code:
```
# Install and load the readxl package

library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Calculate the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```
