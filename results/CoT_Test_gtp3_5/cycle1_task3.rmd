prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the R programming language and the `readxl` package to read the gene expression data from the Excel file. Then, we can use some basic functions to extract the information.

First, let's install and load the `readxl` package:

```
  # Install the readxl package
library(readxl)  # Load the readxl package
```

Now, we can read the gene expression data from the Excel file and store it in a variable called `gene_exp_data`:

```
gene_exp_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

To determine the number of genes and samples, we can use the `dim()` function, which returns the dimensions of the data frame. 

```
num_genes <- dim(gene_exp_data)[1]  # Number of genes (number of rows)
num_samples <- dim(gene_exp_data)[2] - 1  # Number of samples (number of columns minus the gene names column)
```

Finally, we can print the values:

```
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

Here is the complete code:

```
  # Install the readxl package
library(readxl)  # Load the readxl package

gene_exp_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

num_genes <- dim(gene_exp_data)[1]
num_samples <- dim(gene_exp_data)[2] - 1

print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

Remember to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the actual file path if it's located in a different directory.
