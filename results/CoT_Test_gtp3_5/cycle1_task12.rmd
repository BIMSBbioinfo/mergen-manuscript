prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in a table, you can use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions in R. First, you need to read your count table and annotation data into R as data frames using the `read.table()` function. 

Here is the code to read the count table and annotation data:

```
# Read count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
```

Next, you can use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions to count the number of rows and columns in each table:

```
# Count number of rows and columns in count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Count number of rows and columns in annotation data
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)
```

Finally, you can print the counts:

```
# Print counts
cat("Count table has", count_rows, "rows and", count_cols, "columns.\n")
cat("Annotation data has", annotation_rows, "rows and", annotation_cols, "columns.\n")
```

Make sure to replace the file names `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual file names and provide the correct file paths if the files are not in your current working directory.
