prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the count table file and count the number of columns (excluding the first and last columns) to find the number of samples. Additionally, we can count the number of rows to determine the number of genes.

Here's an example code to accomplish this in R:

```
# Read the count table file
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of samples (columns)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Count the number of genes (rows)
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Note that in the code above, it is assumed that the first row of the count table contains column names (header = TRUE) and the columns are separated by tabs (sep = "\t"). You may need to adjust these parameters if the file format is different.

Please make sure to replace "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" with the actual file path/name to run the code successfully.
