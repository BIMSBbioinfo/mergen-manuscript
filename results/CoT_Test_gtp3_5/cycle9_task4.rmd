prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we need to read the count table file and extract the relevant information.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
# Read the count table file
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes (excluding the first and last columns)
num_genes <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- nrow(count_table)

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```

This code assumes that the count table file is located in the current working directory. If the file is located in a different directory, you need to provide the full file path in the `read.table()` function.

After running this code, you will see the number of genes and samples printed in the console.
