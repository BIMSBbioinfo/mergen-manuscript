prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To solve this task, we need to perform a series of steps. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Load the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file, which contains the CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual.

2. Load the "subjects.txt" file, which contains information on the individuals, including their Age, Sex, and Race.

3. Merge the two datasets based on the matching dbGap ID and the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file.

4. Filter the merged dataset to select CpGs associated with Age but not with Sex or Race. 

5. Display the top 20 CpGs based on their association with Age.

Here is the code to perform these steps:

```
# Step 1: Load the CpG methylation values dataset
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, sep = "\t")

# Step 2: Load the subjects information dataset
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, sep = "\t")

# Step 3: Merge the two datasets based on dbGap ID
merged_data <- merge(subjects, metRmOl, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "DBGapId")

# Step 4: Filter CpGs associated with Age but not with Sex or Race
filtered_data <- subset(merged_data, select = c("CpG_ID", "Age", "Sex", "Race"))
filtered_data <- filtered_data[which(!duplicated(filtered_data$CpG_ID)), ]
filtered_data <- subset(filtered_data, select = -c("Age", "Sex", "Race"))

# Step 5: Display the top 20 CpGs associated with Age
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_data[order(-filtered_data$Age), ], 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

Please note that you may need to adjust the file paths and file reading parameters based on your specific setup. Also, make sure that the column names in the datasets match the ones mentioned in the task instructions.
