prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we will need to perform a merge operation between the two datasets based on the common "DBGap ID" column. Then, we will filter the merged dataset to select only those CpGs associated with Age and not with sex or Race. Finally, we will display the top 20 CpGs.

Here is the step-by-step solution with the corresponding code:

1. Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file containing CpG methylation values per individual.

```
# Read CpG methylation values per individual
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
```

2. Read the "subjects.txt" file containing information on individuals.

```
# Read information on individuals
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)
```

3. Merge the two datasets based on the common "DBGap ID" column.

```
# Merge datasets based on "DBGap ID"
merged_data <- merge(methylation_data, subjects_data, by.x = 0, by.y = "dbGap ID")
```

4. Filter the merged dataset to select only those CpGs associated with Age and not with sex or Race.

```
# Filter dataset to select CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered_data <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$Age) & is.na(merged_data$sex) & is.na(merged_data$Race), ]
```

5. Display the top 20 CpGs.

```
# Display top 20 CpGs
top_20_CpGs <- head(filtered_data, 20)
top_20_CpGs
```

This code will give you the top 20 CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, based on the provided datasets.

Please note that this solution assumes that the datasets are correctly formatted and that the "DBGap ID" column in the "subjects.txt" file matches the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file. If there are any inconsistencies or formatting issues, the code may need to be adapted accordingly.
