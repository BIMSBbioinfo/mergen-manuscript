prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the following libraries in R:

- `readxl` for reading the count table from the Excel file
- `limma` for normalizing the counts
- `tidyverse` for data manipulation and plotting
- `ggfortify` for PCA plot visualization

Here are the steps to accomplish the task:

1. Install and load the required libraries:

```


library(readxl)
library(limma)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggfortify)
```

2. Read the count table from the Excel file:

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

3. Read the annotation data:

```
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

4. Normalize the counts using the `voom` function from the `limma` package:

```
normalized_counts <- voom(count_table)
```

5. Join the normalized counts with the annotation data by matching the sample IDs:

```
joined_data <- normalized_counts %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "gene") %>%
  inner_join(annotation_data, by = c("gene" = "Sample_ID"))
```

6. Create a PCA plot color-coded by the "group" column:

```
pca_group <- prcomp(joined_data[, -c(1:5)], scale = TRUE)

ggplot(pca_group$x, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("PC1") +
  ylab("PC2") +
  ggtitle("PCA Plot (Color-coded by group)")
```

7. Create a PCA plot color-coded by the "LibrarySelection" column:

```
pca_library <- prcomp(joined_data[, -c(1:5)], scale = TRUE)

ggplot(pca_library$x, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("PC1") +
  ylab("PC2") +
  ggtitle("PCA Plot (Color-coded by LibrarySelection)")
```

Code: 

```


library(readxl)
library(limma)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggfortify)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

normalized_counts <- voom(count_table)

joined_data <- normalized_counts %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "gene") %>%
  inner_join(annotation_data, by = c("gene" = "Sample_ID"))

pca_group <- prcomp(joined_data[, -c(1:5)], scale = TRUE)

ggplot(pca_group$x, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA Plot (Color-coded by group)")

pca_library <- prcomp(joined_data[, -c(1:5)], scale = TRUE)

ggplot(pca_library$x, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA Plot (Color-coded by LibrarySelection)")
```
