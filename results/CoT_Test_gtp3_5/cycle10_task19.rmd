prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the R programming language and some commonly used packages for data analysis and visualization, such as `readxl`, `edgeR`, and `ggplot2`. 

Here are the step-by-step instructions to normalize counts, create PCA plots, and color code them by "group" and "LibrarySelection":

Step 1: Load the required packages
We need to load the necessary packages `readxl`, `edgeR`, and `ggplot2`.

```
library(readxl)
library(edgeR)
library(ggplot2)
```

Step 2: Read the count table and annotation data
Read the count table from the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" file and the annotation data from the "SRP021193.colData.tsv" file.

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

Step 3: Normalize counts using the TMM method
We will use the edgeR package to normalize the counts using the Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) method.

```
# Convert count table to DGEList object
dge <- DGEList(counts = count_table[, -1], genes = count_table[, 1])

# Calculate common dispersion
dge <- estimateCommonDisp(dge)

# Estimate tagwise dispersion
dge <- estimateTagwiseDisp(dge)

# Normalize counts using the TMM method
dge <- calcNormFactors(dge)
norm_counts <- cpm(dge, log = TRUE)
```

Step 4: Merge the normalized counts with the annotation data
We need to merge the normalized counts with the annotation data based on the sample ids.

```
# Get the sample ids from the normalized counts
sample_ids <- colnames(norm_counts)

# Merge counts with annotation data
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, norm_counts, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = "row.names")
```

Step 5: Perform PCA on normalized counts
We will compute the principal components on the normalized counts.

```
# Extract normalized counts
normalized_counts <- merged_data[, -(1:5)]

# Perform PCA on normalized counts
pca <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts), scale. = TRUE)
```

Step 6: Create the PCA plots
We will create two PCA plots, one color-coded by "group" and the other color-coded by "LibrarySelection".

```
# Create PCA plot - color coded by "group"
ggplot(data = merged_data, aes(x = pca$x[, 1], y = pca$x[, 2], color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("PCA Plot - Color coded by Group")

# Create PCA plot - color coded by "LibrarySelection"
ggplot(data = merged_data, aes(x = pca$x[, 1], y = pca$x[, 2], color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("PCA Plot - Color coded by Library Selection")
```

That's it! The provided code will help you normalize counts, create two PCA plots, and color code them by "group" and "LibrarySelection" using the provided count table and annotation data.

Note: Make sure to adjust the file paths in the `read_excel()` and `read.table()` functions to match the location of your files.
