prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate the number of columns, we can follow these steps:

1. Load the necessary libraries for reading and manipulating data frames. In this case, we will use the `readxl` package to read the Excel file and the `dplyr` package for data manipulation.

```
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data into separate data frames.

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

3. Perform a left join on the sample IDs to merge the count table and annotation data based on matching sample IDs.

```
merged_data <- count_table %>%
  left_join(annotation_data, by = c("SampleID" = "sample_id"))
```

4. Calculate the number of columns in the merged data frame.

```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

Finally, we can print the number of columns using the `num_columns` variable.

```
num_columns
```

Here is the complete code:

```
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

merged_data <- count_table %>%
  left_join(annotation_data, by = c("SampleID" = "sample_id"))

num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

num_columns
```
Note: Replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths or URLs in your system.
