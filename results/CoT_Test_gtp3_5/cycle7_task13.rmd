prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, you can use the `merge()` function in R. Here is an example of how you can perform this task:

Step 1: Import the necessary libraries for data manipulation and reading Excel files.
```
library(openxlsx)  # For reading Excel files
```

Step 2: Read the count table and annotation data from their respective files.
```
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", startRow = 1)
annotation_data <- read.xlsx("SRP021193.colData.tsv", startRow = 1)
```

Step 3: Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample IDs.
```
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_ids", by.y = "sample_ids")
```

Step 4: Calculate the number of columns in the merged data.
```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

Here is the complete code block:
```
library(openxlsx)

count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", startRow = 1)
annotation_data <- read.xlsx("SRP021193.colData.tsv", startRow = 1)

merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_ids", by.y = "sample_ids")

num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
