prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables and count the number of rows and columns in each table, we can use the `read.table()` function in R. 

Here is the code to achieve this:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
met_table <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
# Count the number of rows and columns in the met_table
num_rows_met <- nrow(met_table)
num_cols_met <- ncol(met_table)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects_table <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)
# Count the number of rows and columns in the subjects_table
num_rows_subjects <- nrow(subjects_table)
num_cols_subjects <- ncol(subjects_table)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
cat("Number of rows in met_table:", num_rows_met, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in met_table:", num_cols_met, "\n")

cat("Number of rows in subjects_table:", num_rows_subjects, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in subjects_table:", num_cols_subjects, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace the file names ("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt") with the actual file names and provide the correct file path if the files are not in the current working directory.

This code will read the tables from the files, count the number of rows and columns using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions, and then print the number of rows and columns for each table using the `cat()` function.
