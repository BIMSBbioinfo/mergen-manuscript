prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we will need to combine the two datasets based on the matching dbGap ID column. Then, we can filter the data based on the conditions mentioned and display the top 20 CpGs. Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Read the data from both files into separate data frames.

```
# Read the CpG methylation data
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Read the subject information data
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

Step 2: Merge the two data frames using the dbGap ID column.

```
# Merge the data frames based on dbGap ID column
merged_data <- merge(met_data, subject_data, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGap ID")
```

Step 3: Filter the merged data frame to keep only the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race.

```
# Filter the merged data frame
filtered_data <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$Age) & is.na(merged_data$sex) & is.na(merged_data$Race), ]
```

Step 4: Display the top 20 CpGs.

```
# Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_data$CpG_id, 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

Here is the complete code:

```
# Read the CpG methylation data
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Read the subject information data
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Merge the data frames based on dbGap ID column
merged_data <- merge(met_data, subject_data, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Filter the merged data frame
filtered_data <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$Age) & is.na(merged_data$sex) & is.na(merged_data$Race), ]

# Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_data$CpG_id, 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

Please note that you need to replace the file names `"metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"` and `"subjects.txt"` with the actual file names and make sure they are in the correct directory.
