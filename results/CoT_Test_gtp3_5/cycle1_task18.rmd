prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age, we will first need to merge the two datasets based on the "dbGap ID" column. This will allow us to match the individuals in the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" dataset with their corresponding information in the "subjects.txt" dataset. Once we have the merged dataset, we can then investigate the association between CpGs and Age.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Load the required libraries
```
library(data.table)
```

Step 2: Read the datasets
```
# Read "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"
met_data <- fread("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt")

# Read "subjects.txt"
subject_data <- fread("subjects.txt")
```

Step 3: Merge the datasets based on "dbGap ID"
```
# Merge the datasets based on "dbGap ID"
merged_data <- merge(met_data, subject_data, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = 2)
```

Step 4: Select CpGs associated with Age, but not with sex or Race
```
# Filter CpGs associated with Age, but not with sex or Race
age_cpg <- merged_data[!is.na(Age) & is.na(sex) & is.na(Race), CpG_id]
```

Step 5: Display top 20 CpGs
```
# Display top 20 CpGs associated with Age
top_20_cpg <- head(age_cpg, 20)
top_20_cpg
```

And that's it! The code provided above will merge the datasets and filter out the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race. The final result will display the top 20 CpGs.
