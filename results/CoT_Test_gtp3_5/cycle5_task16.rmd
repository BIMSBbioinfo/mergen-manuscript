prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, we will first read the count table and annotation data into R. Then, we will merge the two datasets based on the sample ids. Finally, we will plot boxplots to visualize the gene expression values per sample, with color-coding based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Read the count table and annotation data
```
# Install the required packages


# Load the required libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

Step 2: Merge the count table and annotation data
```
# Set the row names of the count table to the gene names
row.names(count_table) <- count_table[,1]

# Extract the sample ids from the annotation data
sample_ids <- annotation_data[,1]

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on sample ids
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "row.names", by.y = "V1", all = TRUE)

# Remove the extra row names column
merged_data <- merged_data[,-1]
```

Step 3: Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample with color-coded group variable
```
# Set the group variable as a factor
merged_data$group <- as.factor(merged_data$group)

# Plot boxplots with color-coded group variable
boxplot(merged_data[-1], 
        col = merged_data$group,
        xlab = "Samples",
        ylab = "Gene Expression",
        main = "Gene Expression Values per Sample")
```

Please make sure to provide the correct file paths for the count table and annotation data. Also, ensure that the sample ids in the annotation data match the column names in the count table for successful merging and plotting.
