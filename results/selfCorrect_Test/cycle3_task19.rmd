prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


SRP021193.colData.tsv:
diagnosis	group	LibrarySelection
CASE_1	non-ischemic cardiomyopathy	CASE	cDNA

# Load required packages
library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Extract gene names
genes <- count_table$Genes

# Remove the first column from the count table
count_table <- count_table[, -1]

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Normalize counts using DESeq2
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table, colData = annotation_data, design = ~ 1)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA on normalized counts
pca_normalized <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))
pca_df_normalized <- data.frame(PC1 = pca_normalized$x[, 1], PC2 = pca_normalized$x[, 2], 
                                group = annotation_data$group, LibrarySelection = annotation_data$LibrarySelection)

# Make PCA plot color coded by "group"
ggplot(pca_df_normalized, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "PCA plot (Color coded by group)")

# Make PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection"
ggplot(pca_df_normalized, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "PCA plot (Color coded by LibrarySelection)")

Note: The above code assumes that the required packages `readxl`, `DESeq2`, and `ggplot2` are already installed. If they are not, you can install them using the `install.packages()` function.
