prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	34	63	M	CAUC


response:
```
# Read the file
data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_cols <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of rows and columns
num_rows
num_cols
```
Note that the code assumes that the "subjects.txt" file is in the current working directory. If the file is in a different directory, you will need to provide the full path to the file in the `read.table()` function.
