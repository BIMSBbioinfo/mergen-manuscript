prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

here are first few lines of the file(s).

subjects.txt:
ID	dbGaP ID	Age	sex	Race
1	34	63	M	CAUC


response:
```
# Read the file
data <- read.table("subjects.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Get the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_cols <- ncol(data)

# Print the result
cat("Number of rows:", num_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns:", num_cols, "\n")
```
Note: Make sure to replace "subjects.txt" with the correct file path if it's not in the current working directory.
