prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx:
Genes	CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	 0
TNMD	3281	 7167	 3435	0	 0	0	  202	  403	 203	0	0	21


response:
```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
gene_expression <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expression)
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expression) - 1

num_genes
num_samples
```
Note: In the code above, we assume that the first row contains the column names and the first column contains the gene names. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
