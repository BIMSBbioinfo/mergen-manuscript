prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
```
# Read the tab-separated file
count_table <- read.delim("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Count the number of samples (subtracting 2 for the gene name and gene length columns)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Print the result
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
Note: In the code above, we assume that the file "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" is in the working directory. If the file is located in a different directory, you will need to provide the full file path in the `read.delim()` function.
