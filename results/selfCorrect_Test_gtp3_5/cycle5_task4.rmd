prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

here are first few lines of the file(s).

SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv:
CASE_1	CASE_2	CASE_3	CASE_4	CASE_5	CASE_6	CTRL_1	CTRL_2	CTRL_3	CTRL_4	CTRL_5	CTRL_6	width
TSPAN6	9832	25521	23529	0	32	0	10558	20573	6507	0	0	0	12883


response:
```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```
Note: In the code above, I assume that the column containing gene lengths is the last column in the count table, and therefore subtract 2 from the total number of columns to get the number of samples. Adjust the code accordingly if the gene length column is in a different position.
