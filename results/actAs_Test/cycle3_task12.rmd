prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To count the number of rows and columns in the count table and annotation data, we can use the `readxl` library in R to read the Excel files and the `dim()` function to count the rows and columns.

Here is the code to read the count table and annotation data, and count the number of rows and columns for each:

```
# Install the readxl package if not already installed
install.packages("readxl")

# Load the readxl package
library(readxl)

# Read the count table and annotation data
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_excel("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Count the number of rows and columns in the count table
count_rows <- dim(count_table)[1]
count_cols <- dim(count_table)[2]

# Count the number of rows and columns in the annotation data
annotation_rows <- dim(annotation_data)[1]
annotation_cols <- dim(annotation_data)[2]

# Print the number of rows and columns for each
cat("Count Table: Rows =", count_rows, "Columns =", count_cols, "\n")
cat("Annotation Data: Rows =", annotation_rows, "Columns =", annotation_cols, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual file paths for the count table and annotation data, respectively.

This code will read the Excel files using the `read_excel()` function, count the rows and columns using the `dim()` function, and then print the number of rows and columns for each table using the `cat()` function.
