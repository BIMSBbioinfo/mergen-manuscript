prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the bioinformatics package `Biobase` in R to read the datasets and obtain the number of rows and columns for each table. Here is the code:

```
# Load required libraries
library(Biobase)

# Read the first dataset
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Read the second dataset
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Get the number of rows and columns for each dataset
methylation_rows <- nrow(methylation_data)
methylation_cols <- ncol(methylation_data)

subjects_rows <- nrow(subjects_data)
subjects_cols <- ncol(subjects_data)

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows and columns for the methylation dataset:\n")
cat("Rows:", methylation_rows, "\n")
cat("Columns:", methylation_cols, "\n\n")

cat("Number of rows and columns for the subjects dataset:\n")
cat("Rows:", subjects_rows, "\n")
cat("Columns:", subjects_cols, "\n")
```

Please make sure that the file paths for the datasets are correct before running the code. The code will read the datasets, calculate the number of rows and columns for each table, and print the results.
