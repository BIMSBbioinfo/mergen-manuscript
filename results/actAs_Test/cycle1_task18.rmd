prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapId.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To complete this task, we need to load and process the two datasets - "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt". Then, we can find the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race and display the top 20 CpGs.

Here's the code to accomplish the task:

```
# Load the required packages
library(tidyverse)

# Read the methylation dataset
methylation_data <- read_delim("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", delim = "\t")

# Remove the first row (DBGapId) and transpose the matrix
methylation_data <- t(methylation_data[-1, ])

# Read the subjects dataset
subjects_data <- read_delim("subjects.txt", delim = ",")

# Get the DBGapId column from subjects dataset
dbGapId <- subjects_data[, 2]

# Get the Age, Sex, and Race columns from subjects dataset
age <- subjects_data[, "Age"]
sex <- subjects_data[, "sex"]
race <- subjects_data[, "Race"]

# Find the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
age_specific_cpgs <- names(age)[!names(age) %in% names(sex) & !names(age) %in% names(race)]

# Get the methylation values for the age-specific CpGs
age_specific_cpgs_methylation_data <- methylation_data[age_specific_cpgs, ]

# Display the top 20 age-specific CpGs
top_20_age_specific_cpgs <- age_specific_cpgs_methylation_data[1:20, ]
```

Note: Make sure to replace the file paths `metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt` and `subjects.txt` with the actual file paths in your system.

The `age_specific_cpgs` variable will contain the names of the CpGs associated with age but not with sex or Race. And `top_20_age_specific_cpgs` will contain the methylation values for the top 20 age-specific CpGs.
