prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables, count the number of rows and columns in each table, you can use the `read.table()` function in R. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" table
met_table <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Print the number of rows and columns in the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" table
met_rows <- nrow(met_table)
met_cols <- ncol(met_table)
cat("Number of rows in 'metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt':", met_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in 'metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt':", met_cols, "\n\n")

# Read the "subjects.txt" table
subj_table <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Print the number of rows and columns in the "subjects.txt" table
subj_rows <- nrow(subj_table)
subj_cols <- ncol(subj_table)
cat("Number of row in 'subjects.txt':", subj_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in 'subjects.txt':", subj_cols, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace the file names with the actual file names and provide the correct file paths if the files are not in the current working directory.
