prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

To complete this task, you can use the following code:

```
# Load the required libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(pheatmap)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Set the row names of the count table as gene names
row.names(count_table) <- count_table$gene_names
count_table$gene_names <- NULL

# Normalize the counts using DESeq2
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table,
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~ 1)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds)

# Perform PCA with color-coding by "group"
pca_group <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts),
                    scale = TRUE)
group_annotation <- annotation_data$group

# Perform PCA with color-coding by "LibrarySelection"
pca_library <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts),
                      scale = TRUE)
library_annotation <- annotation_data$LibrarySelection

# Plot the PCA with color-coding by "group"
plot_pca_group <- ggplot(data = as.data.frame(pca_group$x),
                         aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group_annotation)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Color-coded by Group") +
  theme_minimal()

# Plot the PCA with color-coding by "LibrarySelection"
plot_pca_library <- ggplot(data = as.data.frame(pca_library$x),
                           aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = library_annotation)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Color-coded by LibrarySelection") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display both PCA plots
plot_pca_group
plot_pca_library
```

Make sure to place both the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" files in the same directory as the R script.
