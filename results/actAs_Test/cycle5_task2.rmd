prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To find out the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the contents of the file "leukemiaExp.txt" and count the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples). 

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Exclude the first column (gene names)

# Print the results
num_genes   # Number of genes
num_samples # Number of samples
```

This code assumes that the first row of the file contains the column headers and the first column contains the gene names. Adjust the code accordingly if your file structure is different.
