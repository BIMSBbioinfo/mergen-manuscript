prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the readxl package in R to read the gene expression data from the Excel file and then calculate the dimensions of the data frame.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install and load the readxl package
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

# Read the gene expression data from the Excel file
xlsx_file <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"
gene_expression_data <- read_excel(xlsx_file)

# Get the number of genes and samples in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expression_data)
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expression_data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
num_genes
num_samples
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the correct file path or file name if it's in your working directory.
