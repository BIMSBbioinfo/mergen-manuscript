prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the excel sheet and then calculate the dimensions of the resulting dataframe.

First, make sure the `readxl` package is installed by running the following code:

```
install.packages("readxl")
```

Then, load the `readxl` package and read the excel sheet using the `read_excel()` function:

```
library(readxl)

# Replace "path/to/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the actual file path
data <- read_excel("path/to/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

Once the data has been read, you can use the `dim()` function to calculate the number of genes and samples:

```
# Calculate the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- dim(data)[1] - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the gene names column
num_samples <- dim(data)[2]

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

The code above will print the number of genes and samples in the dataset.

```
# Complete code:

install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

# Replace "path/to/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the actual file path
data <- read_excel("path/to/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Calculate the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- dim(data)[1] - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the gene names column
num_samples <- dim(data)[2]

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```
