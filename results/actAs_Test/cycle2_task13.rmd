prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To complete this task, you can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file containing the count table and the `data.table` package to merge the annotation data with the count table based on the sample IDs.

Here's the code to accomplish the task:

```
# Install required packages
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("data.table")

# Load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(data.table)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- fread("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Set the first column as sample IDs in annotation data
setnames(annotation_data, old = names(annotation_data)[1], new = "sample_id")

# Merge annotation data with count table based on sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = "sample_id")

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
print(num_columns)
```

This code reads the count table from the Excel file "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" using the `read_excel` function and the annotation data from the TSV file "SRP021193.colData.tsv" using the `fread` function from the `data.table` package.

Then, it renames the first column in the annotation data to "sample_id" to make it consistent with the sample IDs in the count table.

Next, it merges the count table with the annotation data based on the sample IDs using the `merge` function from the `data.table` package.

Finally, it calculates the number of columns in the merged data using the `ncol` function and prints the result.

Please make sure to adjust the file paths accordingly based on the location of your files.

Note: It's important to mention that the code assumes that the column headers in both the count table and annotation data are consistent and have the same order. If the order or usage of sample IDs is different between the two files, additional adjustments might be needed.
