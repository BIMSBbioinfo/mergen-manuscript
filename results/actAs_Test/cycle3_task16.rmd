prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and the gene expression table, we can follow these steps using R:

1. Install and load the necessary packages: tidyverse, readxl.
2. Read the count table and annotation data files.
3. Rename the first column of the count table to "Gene".
4. Merge the count table with the annotation data based on the sample IDs.
5. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color-coded based on the "group" variable.

Here's the code to accomplish the task:

```
# Step 1: Install and load required packages
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("readxl")
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# Step 2: Read count table and annotation data
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Step 3: Rename the first column of count table as "Gene"
colnames(count_table)[1] <- "Gene"

# Step 4: Merge count table with annotation data
merged_data <- left_join(count_table, annotation_data, by = c("Gene" = "sample_id"))

# Step 5: Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color-coded based on "group" variable
plot <- ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = Gene)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  ggtitle("Gene Expression per Sample") +
  theme_minimal()
plot
```

Make sure to provide the correct file paths for "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv". The resulting plot will show boxplots of gene expression values per sample, with each boxplot colored based on the "group" variable from the annotation data.
