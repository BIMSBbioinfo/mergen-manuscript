prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To find the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the excel sheet and then calculate the number of rows and columns in the dataset.

Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load the readxl package
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns)
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the header row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the gene name column

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the correct path to your excel file.

This code will read the excel file, calculate the number of genes (rows) by subtracting 1 from the total number of rows, and calculate the number of samples (columns) by subtracting 1 from the total number of columns. Finally, it will print the results.

Note: The code assumes that the first row contains the header and the first column contains the gene names, hence subtracting 1 from the total number of rows and columns.
