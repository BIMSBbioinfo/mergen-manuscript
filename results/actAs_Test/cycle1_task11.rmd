prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the `read.table()` function in R to read the datasets and then use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions to count the number of rows and columns in each dataset.

First, let's read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" dataset:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" dataset
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the met_data dataset
met_rows <- nrow(met_data)
met_cols <- ncol(met_data)

# Print the count
cat("Number of rows in met_data:", met_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in met_data:", met_cols, "\n")
```

Next, let's read the "subjects.txt" dataset:

```
# Read the "subjects.txt" dataset
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the subject_data dataset
subject_rows <- nrow(subject_data)
subject_cols <- ncol(subject_data)

# Print the count
cat("Number of rows in subject_data:", subject_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in subject_data:", subject_cols, "\n")
```

Finally, let's put the code together as a single block:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" dataset
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the met_data dataset
met_rows <- nrow(met_data)
met_cols <- ncol(met_data)

# Read the "subjects.txt" dataset
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the subject_data dataset
subject_rows <- nrow(subject_data)
subject_cols <- ncol(subject_data)

# Print the count
cat("Number of rows in met_data:", met_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in met_data:", met_cols, "\n")
cat("Number of rows in subject_data:", subject_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in subject_data:", subject_cols, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the correct file names and paths for your datasets.
