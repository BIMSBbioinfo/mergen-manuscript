prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapId.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To solve this task, we need to:
1. Read the dataset files.
2. Match the DBGap ID column in the "subjects.txt" file with the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file.
3. Identify CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race.
4. Display the top 20 CpGs.

Here is the code to accomplish these tasks:

```
# Read the dataset files
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, sep = "\t")
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Match the DBGap ID column in the "subjects.txt" file with the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
dbGapID <- subjects$`dbGap ID`
metRmOl <- metRmOl[, dbGapID %in% colnames(metRmOl)]

# Identify CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
ageCpGs <- rownames(metRmOl)[apply(subjects, 1, function(x) x["Age"] != "" & x["sex"] == "" & x["Race"] == "")]

# Display the top 20 CpGs
top20CpGs <- head(ageCpGs, 20)
top20CpGs
```

This code reads the two dataset files using the `read.table` function. Then it matches the DBGap ID column in the "subjects.txt" file with the column names of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file. It identifies the CpGs associated with age by checking if the Age column is not empty and the sex and Race columns are empty. Finally, it displays the top 20 CpGs using the `head` function.
