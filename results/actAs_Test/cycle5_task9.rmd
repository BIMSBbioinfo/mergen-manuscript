prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the R programming language and several packages including `limma`, `gplots`, and `ggplot2`. Here are the steps to filter the genes based on variability, plot a heatmap with clustering, and generate a PCA plot for the samples:

Step 1: Load the necessary packages and read the gene expression data from the file "leukemiaExp.txt".

```
# Load necessary packages
library(limma)
library(gplots)
library(ggplot2)

# Read gene expression data from file
gene_expr <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t")
```

Step 2: Filter genes based on variability to retain the top 1000 most variable genes.

```
# Calculate the variance across samples for each gene
gene_expr_var <- apply(gene_expr[, -1], 1, var)

# Sort genes by variability in descending order
sorted_genes <- order(gene_expr_var, decreasing = TRUE)

# Filter the top 1000 most variable genes
top_var_genes <- gene_expr[sorted_genes[1:1000], ]
```

Step 3: Plot a heatmap with clustering using the filtered variable genes.

```
# Calculate the z-score for the gene expression values
z_scores <- scale(top_var_genes[, -1])

# Plot heatmap with clustering
heatmap.2(as.matrix(z_scores), trace = "none", col = heat.colors(256))
```

Step 4: Generate a PCA plot for the samples using the filtered variable genes.

```
# Perform PCA on the gene expression data
pca_result <- prcomp(top_var_genes[, -1])

# Extract PCA scores for the samples
pca_scores <- as.data.frame(pca_result$x)

# Plot PCA using the first two principal components
ggplot(pca_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Principal Component 1", y = "Principal Component 2", title = "PCA Plot")
```

The above code will filter the genes based on variability, plot a heatmap with clustering, and generate a PCA plot for the samples using the top 1000 most variable genes from the "leukemiaExp.txt" file.
