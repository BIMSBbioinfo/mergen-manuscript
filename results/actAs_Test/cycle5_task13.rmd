prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, we can use the `read.table()` function to read the two files. Then, we can use the `merge()` function to combine the two data frames based on the common sample IDs. Finally, we can calculate the number of columns using the `ncol()` function.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by=0)

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```

Please make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file names and paths to the files on your system.

The variable `num_columns` will contain the number of columns in the merged data frame, which represents the number of samples in the experiment.
