prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data, we can use the `read.xlsx()` function from the `readxl` package in R, and the `read.table()` function to read the annotation data in TSV format. We can then use the `dim()` function to count the number of rows and columns in each table.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install required packages if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("readxl", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("readxl")
}

# Load required packages
library(readxl)

# Set the file paths
count_table_file <- "path/to/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"
annotation_file <- "path/to/SRP021193.colData.tsv"

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx(count_table_file, sheet = 1)
count_rows <- dim(count_table)[1]
count_columns <- dim(count_table)[2]

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table(annotation_file, header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
annotation_rows <- dim(annotation_data)[1]
annotation_columns <- dim(annotation_data)[2]

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
cat("Count Table: Rows =", count_rows, "Columns =", count_columns, "\n")
cat("Annotation Data: Rows =", annotation_rows, "Columns =", annotation_columns, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"path/to/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"path/to/SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual file paths to the count table and annotation data files, respectively.

The code will read the count table from the Excel file and count the number of rows and columns using the `dim()` function. Similarly, it will read the annotation data from the TSV file and count the number of rows and columns. Finally, it will print the number of rows and columns for each table.
