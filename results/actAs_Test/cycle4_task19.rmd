prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the R programming language and some bioinformatics packages such as DESeq2 and ggplot2. Here is the code to achieve the desired tasks:

```
# Load required libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table
countTable <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Read the annotation data
annotationData <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Create a DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countTable,
                              colData = annotationData,
                              design = ~ 1)

# Perform normalization
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Get normalized counts
normalizedCounts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA analysis
pca <- prcomp(t(normalizedCounts), scale = TRUE)

# Create PCA plot color coded by "group"
groupColors <- as.factor(annotationData$group)
groupPlot <- ggplot(data = data.frame(pca$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = groupColors)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA plot color coded by group")

# Create PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection"
libraryColors <- as.factor(annotationData$LibrarySelection)
libraryPlot <- ggplot(data = data.frame(pca$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = libraryColors)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA plot color coded by LibrarySelection")

# Display the plots
print(groupPlot)
print(libraryPlot)
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the actual file path to the count table and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file path to the annotation data. The code will read the count data and annotation data, perform normalization using DESeq2, and then create two PCA plots, one color-coded by "group" and the other color-coded by "LibrarySelection".
