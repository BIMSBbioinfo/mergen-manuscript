prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the following steps:

1. Load the required libraries.
2. Read the count table and annotation data.
3. Perform statistical tests to find genes specific for each group.
4. Plot PCA using the group-specific genes and color code by the group variable.

Here is the code to accomplish these steps:

```
# Step 1: Load libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Step 2: Read count table and annotation data
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Step 3: Perform statistical tests to find group-specific genes
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table, colData = annotation_data, design = ~ group)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
res <- results(dds)

# Subset genes with adjusted p-value less than 0.05 and absolute log2 fold change greater than 1
group_specific_genes <- subset(res, padj < 0.05 & abs(log2FoldChange) > 1)

# Step 4: Plot PCA using group-specific genes and color code by group
pca_data <- plotPCA(dds, intgroup = "group", genes = rownames(group_specific_genes), returnData = TRUE)
pca_plot <- ggplot(pca_data, aes(PC1, PC2, color = group)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal()

# Print the PCA plot
print(pca_plot)
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the correct file paths for your system. The code will perform the statistical tests for finding group-specific genes using DESeq2 package, subset the significant genes, and then plot the PCA using ggplot2 package.
