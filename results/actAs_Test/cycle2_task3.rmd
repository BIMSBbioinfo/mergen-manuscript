prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the given gene expression dataset, we can use the readxl package in R to read the Excel file and then retrieve the dimensions of the data frame.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install and load the readxl package
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1   # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column (gene names)

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

In the above code, we first install the readxl package if it's not already installed, and then load it into the R environment. We then read the Excel file using the `read_excel()` function and store the data in the `data` object.

Next, we calculate the number of genes by getting the number of rows in the data frame (`nrow(data)`). To calculate the number of samples, we subtract 1 from the number of columns (`ncol(data) - 1`) because the first column contains gene names.

Finally, we use the `cat()` function to print the results, with appropriate labels.

Please note that you need to provide the correct file path or make sure the Excel file is in the current working directory of your R session.
