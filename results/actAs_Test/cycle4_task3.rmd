prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the gene expression dataset, we can use the "readxl" package in R to read the excel file and then calculate the dimensions of the resulting data frame.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install the required package if not already installed
install.packages("readxl")

# Load the required library
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
gene_expr_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expr_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expr_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

In the code above, we first install the "readxl" package if it is not already installed. Then, we load the package using the `library()` function.  After that, we use the `read_excel()` function to read the excel file into a data frame called `gene_expr_data`.

Next, we calculate the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the total number of rows in `gene_expr_data` (excluding the header row). Similarly, we calculate the number of samples by subtracting 1 from the total number of columns in `gene_expr_data` (excluding the first column).

Finally, we use `cat()` to print the number of genes and samples.

Please make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the actual file path of the excel file containing the gene expression data.
