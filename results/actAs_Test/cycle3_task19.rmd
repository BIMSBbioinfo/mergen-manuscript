prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we'll use the Bioconductor package in R called `DESeq2` for normalizing the counts and `ggplot2` for creating the PCA plots. Here's the code to accomplish the task:

```
# install required packages
install.packages("DESeq2")
install.packages("ggplot2")

# load the required libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# load the count table
count_data <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# load the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# create DESeq2 object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_data, colData = annotation_data, design = ~1)

# normalize counts
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# perform PCA
pca <- prcomp(t(assay(dds, normalized=TRUE)), scale = TRUE)

# create first PCA plot color coded by "group"
plot_data <- data.frame(PC1 = pca$x[,1], PC2 = pca$x[,2], Group = annotation_data$group)
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Group")

# create second PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection"
plot_data <- data.frame(PC1 = pca$x[,1], PC2 = pca$x[,2], LibrarySelection = annotation_data$LibrarySelection)
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - LibrarySelection")
```

Make sure to replace the file paths and column names in the code with the appropriate ones for your dataset. The PCA plots will be displayed as separate plots in the R graphics device, each labeled with the corresponding color coding.
