prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, we will use the `read_excel` function from the `readxl` package to read the count table and the `read.delim` function to read the annotation data. We will then use the `merge` function to merge the two data frames based on the sample IDs.

Here's the code to achieve this:

```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merge the count table with annotation data based on sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "gene names", by.y = "sample ids")

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the actual file path of your count table, and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual file path of your annotation data. The merged data frame will be stored in the `merged_data` variable, and the number of columns will be stored in the `num_columns` variable.
