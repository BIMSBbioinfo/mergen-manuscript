prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will need to use multiple R packages, such as `readxl`, `DESeq2`, and `ggplot2`. Here's a step-by-step approach to complete the task:

1. Install and load the required packages:

```
install.packages(c("readxl", "DESeq2", "ggplot2"))
library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data:

```
count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

3. Separate the gene names from the count data:

```
genes <- count_data[, 1]
count_matrix <- count_data[, -1]
```

4. Create a DESeqDataSet object:

```
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_matrix, colData = annotation_data, design = ~1)
```

5. Normalize the counts using the DESeq2 package:

```
dds_normalized <- DESeq(dds)
```

6. Perform PCA analysis and create the plot based on the "group" variable:

```
rld <- rlogTransformation(dds_normalized)
pca_group <- plotPCA(rld, intgroup = "group", returnData = TRUE)
plot_pca_group <- ggplot(data = pca_group, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot: Samples color-coded by 'group'")
```

7. Perform PCA analysis and create the plot based on the "LibrarySelection" variable:

```
pca_library <- plotPCA(rld, intgroup = "LibrarySelection", returnData = TRUE)
plot_pca_library <- ggplot(data = pca_library, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot: Samples color-coded by 'LibrarySelection'")
```

8. Display the PCA plots:

```
print(plot_pca_group)
print(plot_pca_library)
```

Finally, here's the complete code:

```
install.packages(c("readxl", "DESeq2", "ggplot2"))
library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

genes <- count_data[, 1]
count_matrix <- count_data[, -1]

dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_matrix, colData = annotation_data, design = ~1)

dds_normalized <- DESeq(dds)

rld <- rlogTransformation(dds_normalized)
pca_group <- plotPCA(rld, intgroup = "group", returnData = TRUE)
plot_pca_group <- ggplot(data = pca_group, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot: Samples color-coded by 'group'")

pca_library <- plotPCA(rld, intgroup = "LibrarySelection", returnData = TRUE)
plot_pca_library <- ggplot(data = pca_library, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot: Samples color-coded by 'LibrarySelection'")

print(plot_pca_group)
print(plot_pca_library)
```

Make sure to replace the file paths with the actual file paths for your count table and annotation data.
