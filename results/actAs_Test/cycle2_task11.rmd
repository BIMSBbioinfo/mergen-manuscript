prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To complete this task, you can use the `read.table()` function in R to read the datasets and then use the `dim()` function to count the number of rows and columns in each dataset. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the first dataset
df1 <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the first dataset
num_rows_df1 <- dim(df1)[1]
num_cols_df1 <- dim(df1)[2]

# Read the second dataset
df2 <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in the second dataset
num_rows_df2 <- dim(df2)[1]
num_cols_df2 <- dim(df2)[2]

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows and columns in the first dataset:", "\n")
cat("Rows:", num_rows_df1, "\n")
cat("Columns:", num_cols_df1, "\n")

cat("Number of rows and columns in the second dataset:", "\n")
cat("Rows:", num_rows_df2, "\n")
cat("Columns:", num_cols_df2, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"` and `"subjects.txt"` with the actual file paths for the datasets. The code will read the datasets, count the number of rows and columns in each dataset, and then print the results.
