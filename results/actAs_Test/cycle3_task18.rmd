prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapId.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To solve this task, we need to join the two datasets based on the common column, which is the "dbGap ID" in both datasets. Then we can filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race.

Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Join the datasets based on 'dbGap ID' column
merged_data <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "dbGap.ID", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered_data <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$Age) & is.na(merged_data$sex) & is.na(merged_data$Race), ]

# Sort the CpGs based on methylation values in descending order
sorted_data <- filtered_data[order(-filtered_data$CpG_id), ]

# Display top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- sorted_data[1:20, ]

# Print the results
print(top_20_cpgs)
```

Please note that you need to replace the file paths `"metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"` and `"subjects.txt"` with the actual file paths of your datasets.

This code will join the two datasets based on the common column "dbGap ID", filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, sort them based on methylation values, and display the top 20 CpGs.
