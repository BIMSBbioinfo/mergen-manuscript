prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

response:
To read the tab-separated file "subjects.txt" and determine the number of rows and columns, we can use the read.delim() function in R. This function is specifically designed to read tab-separated files.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the tab-separated file
data <- read.delim("subjects.txt", sep="\t")

# Determine the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_cols <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of rows and columns
cat("Number of rows:", num_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns:", num_cols)
```

Please ensure that the "subjects.txt" file is present in the current working directory or provide the proper file path if it's located elsewhere.
