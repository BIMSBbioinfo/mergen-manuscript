prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the necessary libraries for reading Excel files and working with data frames:

```
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data into data frames:

```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

3. Rename the first column of the count table as "gene" for consistency:

```
colnames(count_table)[1] <- "gene"
```

4. Merge the count table and annotation data based on the matching sample ids:

```
merged_data <- inner_join(count_table, annotation_data, by = c("gene" = "sampleid"))
```

5. Calculate the number of columns in the merged data, excluding the "gene" column:

```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data) - 1
```

6. Print the number of columns:

```
num_columns
```

Here is the complete code:

```
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

colnames(count_table)[1] <- "gene"

merged_data <- inner_join(count_table, annotation_data, by = c("gene" = "sampleid"))

num_columns <- ncol(merged_data) - 1

num_columns
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths of your count table and annotation data, respectively.
