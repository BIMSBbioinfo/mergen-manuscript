prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data in R, we can use the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package to read the count table and the `read.table()` function to read the annotation data. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count number of rows and columns for each table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_columns <- ncol(count_table)

annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_columns <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
print(count_rows)
print(count_columns)
print(annotation_rows)
print(annotation_columns)
```

Make sure to change the file paths according to the location of your files. The code will print the number of rows and columns for both the count table and the annotation data.
