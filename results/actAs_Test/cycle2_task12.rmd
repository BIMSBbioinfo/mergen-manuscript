prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data, we can use the `read.xlsx()` and `read.table()` functions respectively. To count the number of rows and columns in each table, we can use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions.

Here's the code to accomplish the task:

```
# Load required libraries
library(openxlsx)

# Read count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the results
cat("Count Table: Rows =", count_rows, "Columns =", count_cols, "\n")
cat("Annotation Data: Rows =", annotation_rows, "Columns =", annotation_cols, "\n")
```

Make sure that the `Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx` and `SRP021193.colData.tsv` files are in the current working directory or provide the full file paths in the `read.xlsx()` and `read.table()` functions.

This code will read the count table and annotation data, and then display the number of rows and columns for each table.
