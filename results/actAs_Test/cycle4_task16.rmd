prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples,"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, we can use the `read.xlsx` function from the `openxlsx` package to read the count table and the `read.table` function to read the annotation data. Then, we'll merge the two datasets based on the sample IDs.

To plot the boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code them based on the 'group' variable in the annotation data, we can use the `boxplot` function in combination with the `ggplot2` package.

Here's the code to accomplish these tasks:

```
# Load required packages
library(openxlsx)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", startRow = 1)

# Read the annotation data
annotation <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(annotation, count_table, by.x = "sample.ids", by.y = "GeneNames", all = TRUE)

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code based on the 'group' variable
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = factor(group), y = Sample1)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Expression Value", title = "Gene Expression Boxplots per Sample")
```

Note: Replace "Sample1" in the `ggplot` function with the appropriate column names from your count table for each sample.

Make sure to have the `openxlsx` and `ggplot2` packages installed before running the code (`install.packages("openxlsx")` and `install.packages("ggplot2")`).
