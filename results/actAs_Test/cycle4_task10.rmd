prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes cluster the samples, and extract cluster specific genes for each cluster.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the R programming language and several bioinformatics packages such as limma, cluster, and pheatmap.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Load the necessary libraries:

```
library(limma)
library(cluster)
library(pheatmap)
```

2. Read the gene expression data from the file "leukemiaExp.txt":

```
# Replace "path_to_file" with the actual file path
data <- read.delim("path_to_file/leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
```

3. Filter genes based on their variability to retain the top 1000 most variable genes:

```
# Compute the variance of gene expression across samples
variances <- apply(data, 1, var)

# Sort the genes based on their variance in descending order
sorted_genes <- names(sort(variances, decreasing = TRUE))

# Select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000]

# Filter the data to retain only the top variable genes
filtered_data <- data[top_genes, ]
```

4. Cluster the samples using hierarchical clustering:

```
# Compute the distance matrix based on the filtered data
distances <- dist(t(filtered_data))

# Perform hierarchical clustering using complete linkage method
hc <- hclust(distances, method = "complete")

# Assign samples to clusters based on a desired height threshold
cut_height <- 100  # Adjust this threshold as needed
clusters <- cutree(hc, h = cut_height)

# Create a vector of cluster labels for each sample
sample_labels <- paste("Cluster", clusters, sep = "")

# Plot the sample clustering dendrogram
plot(hc)
```

5. Extract cluster-specific genes for each cluster:

```
# Create a list to store cluster-specific genes
cluster_genes <- vector("list", length(unique(clusters)))

# Iterate over each cluster and extract genes specific to that cluster
for (i in unique(clusters)) {
  cluster_samples <- which(clusters == i)  # Get sample indices for the current cluster
  cluster_data <- filtered_data[, cluster_samples]  # Select samples for the current cluster
  
  # Compute the variance of gene expression across samples within the cluster
  cluster_variances <- apply(cluster_data, 1, var)
  
  # Sort the genes based on their variance within the cluster in descending order
  sorted_cluster_genes <- names(sort(cluster_variances, decreasing = TRUE))
  
  # Select the top 100 genes specific to the cluster
  cluster_genes[[i]] <- sorted_cluster_genes[1:100]
}
```

6. Print the cluster-specific genes for each cluster:

```
# Print the cluster-specific genes
for (i in unique(clusters)) {
  cat("Cluster", i, "genes:", paste(cluster_genes[[i]], collapse = ", "), "\n")
}
```

That's it! The code above will read the gene expression data, filter genes based on their variability, cluster the samples, and extract cluster-specific genes for each cluster.

Please note that you need to replace "path_to_file" in Step 2 with the actual file path to "leukemiaExp.txt". Adjust the cluster height threshold in Step 4 according to your data.
