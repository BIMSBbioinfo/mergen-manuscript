prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the data from the file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Check the number of columns
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Define a condition to check if there are more than 500 samples
if (num_samples > 500) {
  # Set a seed for reproducibility
  set.seed(123)
  
  # Randomly sample 500 samples
  sampled_data <- data[, sample(num_samples, 500)]
} else {
  # If there are less than or equal to 500 samples, use the original data
  sampled_data <- data
}

# Print the resulting subset of the data
print(sampled_data)
```
Note: Replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file name/path if it's different.
