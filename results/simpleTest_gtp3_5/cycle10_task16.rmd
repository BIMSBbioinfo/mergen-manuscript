prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

```
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

# Read in the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read in the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Rename the first column of the annotation data to match the column names of the count table
colnames(annotation_data)[1] <- colnames(count_table)[1]

# Merge the annotation data and count table
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = colnames(count_table)[1])

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = gene_name)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene expression") +
  theme_minimal()
