prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the data and merge them into a single table using dbGapId information, return the number of columns.

response:
```
# Read the data from "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Read the data from "subjects.txt"
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Merge the two data frames based on the matching DBGapId
merged_data <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "DBGapId", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Return the number of columns in the merged data
col_count <- ncol(merged_data)

col_count
```
Note: Make sure to replace the file names ("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt") with the actual file names and provide the correct file paths if the files are not in the current working directory.
