prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
# Load required libraries
library(gplots)
library(pheatmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(prcomp)

# Read the gene expression data
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Remove first column of gene names
data <- data[, -1]

# Calculate the variance for each gene
variance <- apply(data, 1, var)

# Get the indices of the top 1000 most variable genes
top_genes <- order(variance, decreasing = TRUE)[1:1000]

# Subset the data to retain only the top 1000 variable genes
filtered_data <- data[top_genes, ]

# Perform clustering on the filtered data and create a heatmap
heatmap_data <- as.matrix(filtered_data)
heatmap(heatmap_data, Colv = NA, Rowv = NA, scale = "row", main = "Gene Expression Heatmap")

# Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
pca <- prcomp(filtered_data, scale = TRUE)

# Plot the PCA results
pca_data <- as.data.frame(pca$x[, 1:2])
pca_plot <- ggplot(pca_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2") + ggtitle("PCA")
pca_plot

```
Note: Replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file name and path if it is located in a different directory.
