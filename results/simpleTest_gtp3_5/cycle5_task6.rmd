prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Check the number of samples in the data
num_samples <- ncol(gene_data)

# Check if there are more than 500 samples
if (num_samples > 500) {
  # Set the seed for reproductibility
  set.seed(123)
  
  # Randomly sample 500 samples without replacement
  samples_to_keep <- sample(1:num_samples, size = 500, replace = FALSE)
  
  # Subset the data with the selected samples
  gene_data_sub <- gene_data[, samples_to_keep]
  
  # Print the subsetted data
  gene_data_sub
} else {
  # Print the original data since there are less than or equal to 500 samples
  gene_data
}
```
Note: Replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file name/path.
