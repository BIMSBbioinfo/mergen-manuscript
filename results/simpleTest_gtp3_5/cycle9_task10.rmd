prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes cluster the samples, and extract cluster specific genes for each cluster.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
gene_expression <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE, row.names=1)
# Calculate the variance of each gene
gene_variance <- apply(gene_expression, 1, var)
# Sort genes based on variance in descending order
sorted_genes <- gene_expression[order(gene_variance, decreasing=TRUE), ]
# Retain the top 1000 genes with highest variance
top_var_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000, ]
# Cluster the samples based on the expression of variable genes
sample_clusters <- kmeans(t(top_var_genes), centers=5)  # Assuming we want 5 clusters
# Extract cluster specific genes for each cluster
cluster_specific_genes <- list()
for (i in 1:5) {
  cluster_samples <- which(sample_clusters$cluster == i)
  cluster_expression <- gene_expression[, cluster_samples]
  cluster_variance <- apply(cluster_expression, 1, var)
  sorted_genes <- gene_expression[order(cluster_variance, decreasing=TRUE), ]
  cluster_specific_genes[[i]] <- sorted_genes[1:100, ]  # Assuming we want top 100 cluster specific genes
}
```
