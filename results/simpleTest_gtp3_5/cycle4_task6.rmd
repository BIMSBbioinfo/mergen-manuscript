prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from file
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Check the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(gene_data) - 1  # Exclude the first column for gene names

# If there are more than 500 samples, randomly sample 500 samples
if (num_samples > 500) {
  set.seed(123)  # Set seed for reproducibility
  sampled_cols <- sample(colnames(gene_data)[-1], size = 500)
  subset_gene_data <- gene_data[, c("Gene", sampled_cols)]
} else {
  subset_gene_data <- gene_data  # No need to subset if there are less than or equal to 500 samples
}

# Print the subsetted gene expression data
subset_gene_data
```
Note: Replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file path and name where your gene expression data is located.
