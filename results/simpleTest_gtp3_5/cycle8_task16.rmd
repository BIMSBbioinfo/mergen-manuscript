prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
```
# Load required libraries
library(openxlsx)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Read count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Set row names of count table to gene names
rownames(count_table) <- count_table[, 1]
count_table <- count_table[, -1] # Remove the first column (gene names)

# Merge annotation data and count table
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = "")

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = .)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "gray", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Group") +
  theme_classic()
```
Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the correct file paths for your system.
