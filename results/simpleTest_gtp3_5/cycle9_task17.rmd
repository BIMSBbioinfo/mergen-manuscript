prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Build a predictive model to predict Age from methylation values, and display most important variables for the predictive models.

```
# Read the datasets
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Transpose the methylation data so each row is a CpG and each column is an individual
methylation_data <- t(methylation_data)

# Set the row names of the methylation data to be the first column (CpG_id)
row.names(methylation_data) <- methylation_data[,1]
methylation_data <- methylation_data[, -1]

# Match the dbGap ID column in subjects data with the column names in the methylation data
index <- match(subjects_data$dbGap.ID, colnames(methylation_data))

# Create a new data frame with matched dbGap ID and corresponding methylation data
data <- data.frame(Age = subjects_data$Age, methylation_data[, index])

# Remove any rows with missing values
data <- na.omit(data)

# Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing)
set.seed(123)
train_index <- sample(1:nrow(data), 0.8*nrow(data))
train_data <- data[train_index, ]
test_data <- data[-train_index, ]

# Build the predictive model using linear regression
model <- lm(Age ~ ., data = train_data)

# Display the most important variables for the predictive model
summary(model)
