prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the .tsv file
counts <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(counts)

# Count the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(counts) - 2

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
Note: In the code, I assumed that the first two columns in the count table are not the sample columns, hence `ncol(counts) - 2` is used to calculate the number of samples. If the first two columns are also sample columns, you can change it to `ncol(counts) - 1`.
