prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# get the number of genes (excluding the first and last columns)
num_of_genes <- nrow(count_table) - 1 

# get the number of samples (excluding the first and last columns)
num_of_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Printing the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_of_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_of_samples, "\n")
```
