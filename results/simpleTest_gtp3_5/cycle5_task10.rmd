prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes cluster the samples, and extract cluster specific genes for each cluster.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Calculate the variability of each gene
variances <- apply(data[, -1], 1, var)

# Sort the genes based on their variability in descending order
sorted_genes <- data[order(variances, decreasing = TRUE), ]

# Get the top 1000 most variable genes
top_1000_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000, ]

# Perform clustering on the samples using the top 1000 genes
library(dendextend)
library(heatmaply)

clusters <- hclust(dist(t(top_1000_genes[-1, ])))
cluster_labels <- cutree(clusters, k = 4) # Assuming 4 clusters

# Extract cluster specific genes for each cluster
cluster_specific_genes <- lapply(unique(cluster_labels), function(cluster) {
  cluster_genes <- top_1000_genes[-1, ][cluster_labels == cluster, ]
  cluster_genes
})

# Print the cluster specific genes for each cluster
for (i in 1:length(cluster_specific_genes)) {
  cat("Cluster", i, " specific genes:\n")
  print(cluster_specific_genes[[i]][, 1])
  cat("\n")
}
```
Note: The code assumes that you have already installed and loaded the `dendextend` and `heatmaply` packages for clustering and heatmap visualization.
