prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

```
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(pcaMethods)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Rename the columns of count table
colnames(count_table) <- c("Genes", colnames(count_table)[-1])

# Normalize counts
normalized_counts <- normalize(count_table[,-1])

# Add sample annotation to normalized counts
normalized_counts$Group <- annotation_data$group
normalized_counts$LibrarySelection <- annotation_data$LibrarySelection

# Perform PCA
pca <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts[,-ncol(normalized_counts)]))

# Create color-coded PCA plot by "group"
ggplot(data = normalized_counts, aes(x = pca$x[,1], y = pca$x[,2], color = Group)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA plot - Sample Groups") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

# Create color-coded PCA plot by "LibrarySelection"
ggplot(data = normalized_counts, aes(x = pca$x[,1], y = pca$x[,2], color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA plot - Library Selection") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
}
```
Note: Code assumes that the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" files are in the working directory.
