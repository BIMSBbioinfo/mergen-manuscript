prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

response:
```
# Read the file
data <- read.delim("subjects.txt", sep = "\t")

# Check the dimensions of the data frame
rows <- nrow(data)
columns <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of rows and columns
print(paste("Number of rows:", rows))
print(paste("Number of columns:", columns))
```
Note: Replace "subjects.txt" with the actual file path/name if it's located in a different directory.
