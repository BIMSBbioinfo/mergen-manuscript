prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the excel sheet using the readxl library
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes by counting the rows excluding the header
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1

# Get the number of samples by counting the columns excluding the gene names column
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```
Please note that you need to have the `readxl` library installed in your R environment to read the Excel file. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using the command ``.
