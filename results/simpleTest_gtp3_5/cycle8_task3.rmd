prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
There are different ways to count the number of genes and samples in the dataset using R. One approach is to use the `readxl` package to read the excel sheet and then use the functions `nrow()` and `ncol()` to count the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) respectively.

```
# Load the readxl package
library(readxl)

# Read the excel sheet
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column

# Print the number of genes and samples
num_genes
num_samples
```

This code assumes that the excel file "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" is located in the current working directory. If it is in a different directory, you need to specify the correct path to the file.
