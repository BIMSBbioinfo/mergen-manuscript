prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data. Create a boxplot of the columns

response:
```
# Read in the gene expression data
gene_expression <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header=TRUE, sep="\t")

# Check the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expression)
if (num_samples > 500) {
  # Randomly select 500 samples
  selected_samples <- sample(1:num_samples, 500)
  # Subset the data to the selected samples
  gene_expression_subset <- gene_expression[, selected_samples]
} else {
  gene_expression_subset <- gene_expression
}

# Create a boxplot of the columns
boxplot(gene_expression_subset, main="Boxplot of Gene Expression", xlab="Columns", ylab="Expression Level")
```
Note: Remember to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with your actual file name if it's different.
