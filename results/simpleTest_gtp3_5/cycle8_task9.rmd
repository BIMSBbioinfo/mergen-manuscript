prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
# Load required libraries
library(gplots)
library(ggplot2)
library(gdata)

# Read gene expression data from file
gene_expression <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Calculate the variance of each gene
gene_variability <- apply(gene_expression, 1, var)

# Select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_genes <- names(sort(gene_variability, decreasing = TRUE)[1:1000])

# Subset the gene expression data to include only the top variable genes
gene_expression_subset <- gene_expression[top_genes, ]

# Perform clustering and plot heatmap
heatmap.2(as.matrix(gene_expression_subset), trace = "none", col = cm.colors(256), main = "Gene Expression Heatmap")

# Perform PCA and plot
pca_data <- prcomp(t(gene_expression_subset))
pca_plot <- ggplot(data = data.frame(pca_data$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("PCA Plot")
print(pca_plot)
```
