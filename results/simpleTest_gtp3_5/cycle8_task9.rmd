prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")

# Filter genes based on variability
variance_values <- apply(data[, -1], 1, var)
sorted_genes <- data[order(variance_values, decreasing = TRUE), ]

# Retain the most variable top 1000 genes
top_1000_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000, ]

# Plot a heatmap with clustering
heatmap_data <- top_1000_genes[, -1]
heatmap_row_order <- hclust(dist(heatmap_data), method = "complete")$order
heatmap_col_order <- hclust(dist(t(heatmap_data)), method = "complete")$order
heatmap(heatmap_data[heatmap_row_order, heatmap_col_order], 
        Rowv = NA, Colv = NA,
        col = colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(100))

# Plot PCA for samples
pca_data <- prcomp(data[, -1])
plot(pca_data$x[, 1], pca_data$x[, 2], 
     col = palette()[unclass(as.factor(data$Sample))],
     xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2", main = "PCA plot")
```
Note: Make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the full path to the file if it's not in the current working directory.
