prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from file
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Check the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(gene_data)
if(num_samples > 500) {
  # Randomly sample the columns
  sampled_columns <- sample(colnames(gene_data), 500)
  # Subset the data based on the sampled columns
  sampled_data <- gene_data[, sampled_columns]
  # Print the subsetted data
  sampled_data
} else {
  # If the number of samples is less than or equal to 500, just print the original data
  gene_data
}
```
