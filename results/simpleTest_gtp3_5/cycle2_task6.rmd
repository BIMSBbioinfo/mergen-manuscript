prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Check the number of columns in the data
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Check if there are more than 500 columns
if (num_samples > 500) {
  # Randomly sample 500 column indices
  sample_indices <- sample(1:num_samples, size = 500, replace = FALSE)
  
  # Subset the data using the sampled column indices
  subset_data <- data[, sample_indices]
  
  # Update the original data with the subset
  data <- subset_data
}

# Print the resulting data
data
```
