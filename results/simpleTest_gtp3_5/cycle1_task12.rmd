prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
# Get the number of rows and columns
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Read the annotation table
annotation_table <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
# Get the number of rows and columns
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_table)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_table)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
cat("Count Table: Number of rows =", count_rows, ", Number of columns =", count_cols, "\n")
cat("Annotation Table: Number of rows =", annotation_rows, ", Number of columns =", annotation_cols)
```
