prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
```
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)

# Read in count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read in annotation data
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Extract sample names
sample_names <- colnames(count_table)[-1]

# Normalize counts using DESeq2
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = as.matrix(count_table[,-1]), colData = annotation_data, design = ~1)
rld <- rlogTransformation(dds)

# Create PCA plot color coded by "group"
plotPCA(rld, intgroup = "group")

# Create PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection"
plotPCA(rld, intgroup = "LibrarySelection")
```
```
