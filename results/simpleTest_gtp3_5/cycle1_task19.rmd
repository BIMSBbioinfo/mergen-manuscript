prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.csv("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Set the row names of the count table to be the gene names
rownames(count_table) <- count_table[, 1]
count_table <- count_table[, -1]

# Normalize counts using the edgeR package
library(edgeR)
counts <- DGEList(counts = count_table)
norm_counts <- calcNormFactors(counts)

# Perform PCA on the normalized counts
pca_data <- prcomp(t(counts(log(norm_counts))))
pca_scores <- pca_data$x

# Create a plot of the PCA scores, color coded by "group"
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = annotation_data, aes(x = pca_scores[,1], y = pca_scores[,2], color = group)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "PCA plot (Color coded by 'group')")

# Create a plot of the PCA scores, color coded by "LibrarySelection"
ggplot(data = annotation_data, aes(x = pca_scores[,1], y = pca_scores[,2], color = LibrarySelection)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "PCA plot (Color coded by 'LibrarySelection')")
```
Note: This code assumes that the count table file is in a tab-separated format and the annotation data file is in a comma-separated format. Adjust the `sep` parameter in the `read.csv` and `read.delim` functions if your files are in a different format.
