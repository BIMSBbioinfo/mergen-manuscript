prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
```
# Read the data from the metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt file
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Read the data from the subjects.txt file
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Select the columns of interest from the subjects_data
subjects_subset <- subjects_data[, c("dbGap ID", "Age", "sex", "Race")]

# Merge the subjects_subset with methylation_data based on the dbGap ID
merged_data <- merge(subjects_subset, methylation_data, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "DBGapId")

# Filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
age_cpgs <- merged_data[rowSums(is.na(merged_data[, c("Age", "sex", "Race")])) == 0, ]
age_cpgs <- age_cpgs[is.na(age_cpgs$sex) & is.na(age_cpgs$Race), ]

# Display top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(age_cpgs[, -c(1:4)], 20)
top_20_cpgs
```
Note: Make sure to replace the file names ("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt") in the code with the actual names of the files you have.
