prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

```
# Read the metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt file
methylation <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Read the subjects.txt file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Match the dbGap ID column in subjects with the first row of methylation
matched_ids <- intersect(subjects$dbGap.ID, colnames(methylation))

# Subset the methylation table to include only the matched individuals
matched_methylation <- methylation[, matched_ids]

# Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
cpgs <- rownames(matched_methylation) # Get all CpG IDs

age_cpgs <- cpgs[rowSums(matched_methylation[, subjects$Age_colname] > 0) > 0] # CpGs associated with Age
sex_cpgs <- cpgs[rowSums(matched_methylation[, subjects$Sex_colname] > 0) > 0] # CpGs associated with sex
race_cpgs <- cpgs[rowSums(matched_methylation[, subjects$Race_colname] > 0) > 0] # CpGs associated with Race

age_only_cpgs <- setdiff(age_cpgs, union(sex_cpgs, race_cpgs)) # CpGs associated with Age only

# Display top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- age_only_cpgs[1:20]
top_20_cpgs
