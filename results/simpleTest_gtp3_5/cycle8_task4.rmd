prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header=TRUE, sep="\t")

# Get the number of genes
n_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Get the number of samples
n_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2  # Subtract 2 to exclude the gene names and gene length columns

# Print the number of genes and samples
n_genes
n_samples
```
The dataset has `n_genes` genes and `n_samples` - 2 samples.
