prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data file
exp_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Find the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(exp_data)

# Find the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(exp_data)

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```
The number of genes and samples in the dataset will be displayed in the output.
