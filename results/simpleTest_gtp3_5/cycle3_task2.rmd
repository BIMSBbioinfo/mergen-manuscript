prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the data from the file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header=TRUE, sep="\t")

# Get the number of genes (rows)
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# Get the number of samples (columns), excluding the first column which contains gene names
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```
