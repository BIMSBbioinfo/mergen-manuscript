prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

```
# Read the data from the metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt file
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Read the data from the subjects.txt file
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the column names from the met_data
col_names <- colnames(met_data)

# Get the dbGap IDs from the subjects_data
dbGap_ids <- subjects_data$dbGapID

# Find the index of the dbGap IDs in the col_names
dbGap_ids_index <- match(dbGap_ids, col_names)

# Get the columns of interest from the met_data based on dbGap IDs
met_data_subset <- met_data[, dbGap_ids_index]

# Add the CpG_id column to the met_data_subset
met_data_subset$CpG_id <- rownames(met_data)

# Merge the met_data_subset with the subjects_data based on dbGap ID
merged_data <- merge(met_data_subset, subjects_data, by.x = "CpG_id", by.y = "dbGapID", all.x = TRUE)

# Filter the merged_data based on CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered_data <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$Age) & is.na(merged_data$sex) & is.na(merged_data$Race), ]

# Get the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_data$CpG_id, 20)

# Print the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs
```

Note: Please make sure to replace the file names (metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt and subjects.txt) with the correct file names and provide the correct file paths if necessary.
