prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Check the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Check if there are more than 500 samples
if (num_samples > 500) {
  # Set the seed for reproducibility
  set.seed(123)
  
  # Randomly sample 500 columns
  sampled_data <- data[, sample(num_samples, 500)]
} else {
  sampled_data <- data
}

# Print the sampled data
sampled_data
```
Note: Replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file name of your gene expression data file.
