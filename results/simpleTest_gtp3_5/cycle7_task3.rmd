prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Load the required library
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the gene name column
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the sample name column

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
Note: Replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the actual file path if the file is not in the current working directory.
