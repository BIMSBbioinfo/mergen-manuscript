prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
```
# Load necessary libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Read count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# Create DESeq2 dataset
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table, colData = annotation_data, design = ~ 1)

# Perform normalization
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA with coloring by "group"
pca_group <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))
groups <- as.factor(dds$group)
pca_plot_group <- ggplot(data.frame(pca_group$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = groups)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color coded by Group)")

# Perform PCA with coloring by "LibrarySelection"
pca_library <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))
library_selection <- as.factor(dds$LibrarySelection)
pca_plot_library <- ggplot(data.frame(pca_library$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = library_selection)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color coded by LibrarySelection)")

# Output PCA plots
print(pca_plot_group)
print(pca_plot_library)
```
Note: Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths.
