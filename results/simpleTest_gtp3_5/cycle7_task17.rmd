prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Build a predictive model to predict Age from methylation values, and display most important variables for the predictive models. 

response:
```
# Load necessary libraries
library(randomForest)

# Read in the datasets
methylation <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header=TRUE, row.names=1)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header=TRUE)

# Set the rownames of methylation dataset to be equal to the first row of subjects dataset
rownames(methylation) <- subjects$`dbGap ID`

# Merge the two datasets based on dbGap ID
data <- merge(methylation, subjects, by.x="Row.names", by.y="dbGap ID")

# Convert the Age column to numeric
data$Age <- as.numeric(data$Age)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)
train_idx <- sample(1:nrow(data), nrow(data)*0.7)
train <- data[train_idx, ]
test <- data[-train_idx, ]

# Build the random forest model
model <- randomForest(Age ~ ., data=train, importance=TRUE)

# Display the variable importance
var_importance <- importance(model)
print(var_importance)
```
