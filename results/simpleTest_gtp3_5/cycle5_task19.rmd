prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
```
# Load required libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Read count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Read annotation data
anno_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Create DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table, colData = anno_data, design = ~ 1)

# Normalize counts
dds_normalized <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA using normalized counts
pca_normalized <- prcomp(t(dds_normalized))

# Create PCA plot color coded by "group"
pca_plot_group <- ggplot(data = anno_data, aes(x = pca_normalized$x[,1], y = pca_normalized$x[,2], color = group)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2")

# Create PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection"
pca_plot_lib <- ggplot(data = anno_data, aes(x = pca_normalized$x[,1], y = pca_normalized$x[,2], color = LibrarySelection)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2")

# Print PCA plots
print(pca_plot_group)
print(pca_plot_lib)
```
Note: Replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the correct file path/name for your system.
