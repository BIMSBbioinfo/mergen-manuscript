prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table file
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data file
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Merge the annotation data and count table by matching sample ids
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = "sample_id")

# Select the columns with gene names and sample expressions
expression_data <- merged_data[, c("gene_name", colnames(count_table))]

# Reshape the data for plotting
melted_data <- reshape2::melt(expression_data, id.vars = "gene_name", variable.name = "sample", value.name = "expression")

# Plot the boxplots with color coding
ggplot(melted_data, aes(x = sample, y = expression, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Sample", y = "Expression Value", fill = "Group") +
  theme_bw()
```
