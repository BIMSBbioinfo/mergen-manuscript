prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", delim = "\t")

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on sample ids
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = "sample_id")

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code based on "group" variable
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = gene_name)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Gene Expression by Group")
```
Note: Make sure to adjust the file paths and column names in the code according to your actual data.
