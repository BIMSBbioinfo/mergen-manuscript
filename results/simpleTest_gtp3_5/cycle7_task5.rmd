prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt".The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. 

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Calculate the variability of each gene
variability <- apply(data, 1, sd)

# Sort the genes based on their variability in descending order
sorted_genes <- names(variability)[order(variability, decreasing=TRUE)]

# Filter the top 1000 genes with the highest variability
filtered_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000]
```
