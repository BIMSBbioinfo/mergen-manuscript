prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the data and merge them into a single table using dbGapId information, return the number of columns.

response:
```
# Read the data from the files
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt")
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt")

# Set the column names of metRmOl using the first row
colnames(metRmOl) <- metRmOl[1, ]
# Remove the first row
metRmOl <- metRmOl[-1, ]

# Merge the two tables using the dbGapId column
merged_table <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "dbGap.ID", by.y = "dbGap.ID")

# Return the number of columns in the merged table
ncol(merged_table)
```
