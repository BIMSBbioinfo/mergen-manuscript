prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the count table into a data frame
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2  # Subtracting 2 to exclude the first and last columns

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```
There are `num_genes` genes and `num_samples` samples in the dataset.
