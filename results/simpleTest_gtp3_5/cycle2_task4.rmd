prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Print the results
paste("Number of genes:", num_genes)
paste("Number of samples:", num_samples)
```
Note: In this code, it is assumed that the input count table file is in the same directory as the R script or R session in which this code is being executed. If the file is located in a different directory, you would need to provide the appropriate path to the count table file.
