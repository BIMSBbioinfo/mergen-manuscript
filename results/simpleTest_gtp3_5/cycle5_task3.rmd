prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Install the necessary package


# Load the necessary library
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count the number of genes and samples
genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the header row
samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the column containing gene names

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", samples))
```
