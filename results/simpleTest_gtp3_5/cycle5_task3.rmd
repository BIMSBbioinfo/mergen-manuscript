prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Load the required library
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
gene_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Check the dimensions of the dataset
genes <- nrow(gene_data)
samples <- ncol(gene_data)

# Display the number of genes and samples
genes
samples
```
```
