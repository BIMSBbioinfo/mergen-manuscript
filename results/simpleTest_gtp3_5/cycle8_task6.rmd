prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the input data
leukemiaExp <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t")

# Check the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(leukemiaExp) - 1

# Check if there are more than 500 samples
if(num_samples > 500) {
  # Randomly sample 500 samples
  set.seed(123) # set a seed for reproducibility
  sample_cols <- sample(2:num_samples, size = 500, replace = FALSE)
  
  # Create a subset of the data using the randomly sampled columns
  subset_leukemiaExp <- leukemiaExp[, c(1, sample_cols)]
}

```
Note: Replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file name including the path, if it is in a different directory.
