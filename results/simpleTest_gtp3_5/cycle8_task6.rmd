prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Check the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(gene_data)

# Create a subset of the data if there are more than 500 samples
if (num_samples > 500) {
  # Set seed for reproducibility
  set.seed(123)
  
  # Randomly sample 500 samples
  sampled_columns <- sample(1:num_samples, 500)
  
  # Create the subset of the data
  subset_data <- gene_data[, sampled_columns]
  
  # Print the subset of the data
  subset_data
} else {
  # If there are less than or equal to 500 samples, use the original data
  gene_data
}
```
```
