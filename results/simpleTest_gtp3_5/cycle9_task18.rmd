prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

```
# Read the datasets
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Rename the first column in subjects_data to match the DBGap ID
colnames(subjects_data)[1] <- colnames(met_data)[1]

# Merge the datasets based on DBGap ID
merged_data <- merge(met_data, subjects_data, by = "dbGap ID")

# Find CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
age_cpgs <- merged_data[!(is.na(merged_data$Age) | !is.na(merged_data$sex) | !is.na(merged_data$Race)), colnames(met_data)]

# Display top 20 CpGs associated with Age
top_20_age_cpgs <- head(sort(age_cpgs, decreasing = TRUE), 20)

top_20_age_cpgs
