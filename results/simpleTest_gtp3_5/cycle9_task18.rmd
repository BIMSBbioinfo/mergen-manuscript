prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
```
# Read the first dataset
df1 <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Read the second dataset
df2 <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Extract the relevant columns from the second dataset
df2 <- df2[, c("dbGap ID", "Age", "sex", "Race")]

# Rename the first column of the second dataset to match the first row of the first dataset
colnames(df2)[1] <- df2[1, 1]

# Remove the first row of the second dataset
df2 <- df2[-1, ] 

# Find CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
cpgs <- colnames(df1)[colnames(df1) %in% colnames(df2) & !(colnames(df1) %in% c("sex", "Race"))]

# Display top 20 CpGs
head(cpgs, 20)
```
