prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
```
# Load necessary packages
library("readxl")
library("DESeq2")
library("ggplot2")

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", col_names = TRUE)

# Read the annotation data
annotation <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep="\t", header = TRUE)

# Set row names of the count table as gene names
rownames(count_table) <- count_table[,1]
count_table <- count_table[,-1]

# Transpose the count table
count_table <- t(count_table)

# Create DESeqDataSet object for further analysis
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table, colData = annotation, design = ~ 1)

# Normalize counts using DESeq2 method
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Perform PCA analysis on normalized counts
pca <- prcomp(t(assay(dds, normalized=TRUE)), scale.=TRUE)

# Extract PCA scores
pca_scores <- data.frame(pca$x[,c(1,2)])
colnames(pca_scores) <- c("PC1", "PC2")

# Plot PCA color coded by "group"
ggplot(pca_scores, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=group)) + geom_point() + labs(x="PC1", y="PC2") + theme_minimal()

# Plot PCA color coded by "LibrarySelection"
ggplot(pca_scores, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=LibrarySelection)) + geom_point() + labs(x="PC1", y="PC2") + theme_minimal()
```
Note: This code assumes that you have already installed the necessary packages `readxl`, `DESeq2`, and `ggplot2`.
