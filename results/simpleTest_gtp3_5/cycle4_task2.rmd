prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```
Output:
Number of genes: [number of genes in the dataset]
Number of samples: [number of samples in the dataset]
