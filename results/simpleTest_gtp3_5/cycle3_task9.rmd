prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
gene_exp <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Calculate the variability for each gene
gene_variability <- apply(gene_exp, 1, var)

# Select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_var_genes <- names(head(sort(gene_variability, decreasing = TRUE), 1000))

# Filter the gene expression data to retain only the top variable genes
filtered_gene_exp <- gene_exp[top_var_genes, ]

# Compute the distance matrix based on the gene expression data
dist_mat <- dist(filtered_gene_exp)

# Perform hierarchical clustering based on the distance matrix
heatmap_order <- hclust(dist_mat)$order

# Generate the heatmap plot
heatmap(filtered_gene_exp[heatmap_order, ], scale = "row", 
        Colv = NA, main = "Heatmap of Gene Expression")

# Perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the gene expression data
pca_result <- prcomp(t(filtered_gene_exp))

# Generate the PCA plot
plot(pca_result$x[,1], pca_result$x[,2], 
     main = "PCA Plot of Gene Expression", xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")

```
Note: Make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual path to your gene expression data file.
