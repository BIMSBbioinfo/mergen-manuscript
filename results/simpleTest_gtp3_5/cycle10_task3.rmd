prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Load necessary packages
library(readxl)

# Read the excel sheet
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
genes <- nrow(data) - 1 # Substract 1 to exclude the gene names row
samples <- ncol(data) - 1 # Substract 1 to exclude the gene names column

# Print the result
genes
samples
```
