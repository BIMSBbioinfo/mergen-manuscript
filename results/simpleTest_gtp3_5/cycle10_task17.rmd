prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Build a predictive model to predict Age from methylation values, and display most important variables for the predictive models. 

response:
```
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(randomForest)

# Read the methylation data
methylation <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Read the subject data
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Set the column names of methylation data as the first row values
names(methylation) <- methylation[1,]
methylation <- methylation[-1,]

# Merge methylation and subject data based on dbGap ID column
merged_data <- inner_join(methylation, subjects, by = c("BiosampleDbgapId" = "dbGap ID"))

# Convert methylation values to numeric
for (i in 2:length(methylation)) {
  merged_data[, i] <- as.numeric(merged_data[, i])
}

# Train the random forest model
model <- randomForest(Age ~ ., data = merged_data, ntree = 1000)

# Display the importance of variables in the model
varImpPlot(model)
