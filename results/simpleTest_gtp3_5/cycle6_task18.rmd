prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

```
# Read the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Transpose the metRmOl dataset
metRmOl_transposed <- t(metRmOl)

# Get the column names from metRmOl_transposed
column_names <- colnames(metRmOl_transposed)

# Get the dbGap IDs from the first row of metRmOl_transposed
dbGap_ids <- metRmOl_transposed[1, ]

# Find the indices where dbGap IDs match in subjects dataset
matched_indices <- match(dbGap_ids, subjects$dbGap_ID)

# Get the corresponding Age, sex, and Race columns from subjects dataset
age <- subjects$Age[matched_indices]
sex <- subjects$sex[matched_indices]
race <- subjects$Race[matched_indices]

# Find the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
age_only_cpgs <- column_names[age != "" & sex == "" & race == ""]

# Display top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- age_only_cpgs[1:20]

# Print the top 20 CpGs
print(top_20_cpgs)
```

Note: Replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file paths of the datasets.
