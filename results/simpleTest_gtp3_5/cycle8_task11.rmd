prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
```
# Read the metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt file
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count number of rows and columns
met_rows <- nrow(met_data)
met_cols <- ncol(met_data)

# Read the subjects.txt file
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count number of rows and columns
subjects_rows <- nrow(subjects_data)
subjects_cols <- ncol(subjects_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each dataset
cat("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt - Rows:", met_rows, ", Columns:", met_cols, "\n")
cat("subjects.txt - Rows:", subjects_rows, ", Columns:", subjects_cols, "\n")
```
Note: Replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file paths or names of your datasets.
