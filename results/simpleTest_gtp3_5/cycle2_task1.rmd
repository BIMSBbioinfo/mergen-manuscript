prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

response:
```
# Read the file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Get the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(subjects)
num_cols <- ncol(subjects)

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows:", num_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns:", num_cols, "\n")
```
Note: Replace "subjects.txt" with the actual path and name of your file.
