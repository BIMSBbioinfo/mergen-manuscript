prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the dataset
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Check the dimensions of the dataset
genes <- nrow(data)  # Number of genes
samples <- ncol(data)  # Number of samples

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", samples, "\n")
```
Note: Make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file path of your dataset.
