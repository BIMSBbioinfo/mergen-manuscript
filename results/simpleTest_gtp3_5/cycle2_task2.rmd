prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the data file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Check the dimensions of the dataset
genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Exclude the header row
samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Exclude the first column (gene names)

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", samples, "\n")
```
Output:

Number of genes: [number of genes]
Number of samples: [number of samples]
