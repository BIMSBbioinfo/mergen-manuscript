prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
gene_exp_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Calculate the number of genes and samples in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(gene_exp_data)
num_samples <- ncol(gene_exp_data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
The dataset has `<number of genes>` genes and `<number of samples>` samples.
