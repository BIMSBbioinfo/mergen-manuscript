prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes cluster the samples, and extract cluster specific genes for each cluster.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Remove the first column (gene names)
data <- data[, -1]

# Calculate the variance of each gene
variances <- apply(data, 1, var)

# Sort the genes based on their variance in descending order
sorted_genes <- sort(variances, decreasing = TRUE)

# Select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_genes <- names(sorted_genes)[1:1000]

# Create a matrix with only the selected top genes
selected_data <- data[top_genes, ]

# Cluster the samples using hierarchical clustering
diss_matrix <- dist(selected_data)
hc <- hclust(diss_matrix)
clusters <- cutree(hc, k = 5)  # Assuming we want 5 clusters

# Extract cluster specific genes for each cluster
cluster_specific_genes <- list()
for (i in 1:max(clusters)) {
  cluster_samples <- which(clusters == i)
  cluster_data <- selected_data[, cluster_samples]
  cluster_variances <- apply(cluster_data, 1, var)
  cluster_sorted_genes <- sort(cluster_variances, decreasing = TRUE)
  cluster_specific_genes[[i]] <- names(cluster_sorted_genes)[1:100]  # Assuming we want top 100 specific genes per cluster
}

# Output the cluster specific genes
for (i in 1:max(clusters)) {
  cat("Cluster", i, "specific genes:", cluster_specific_genes[[i]], "\n")
}
```
Note: This code assumes that the number of samples is larger than the number of genes. If the number of genes is larger than the number of samples, you may need to transpose the data before applying the code.
