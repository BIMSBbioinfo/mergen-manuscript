prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes cluster the samples, and extract cluster specific genes for each cluster.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Calculate the variability of each gene by calculating the standard deviation
variance <- apply(data[, -1], 1, sd)

# Order the genes based on their variability in descending order
ordered_genes <- order(variance, decreasing = TRUE)

# Select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_1000_genes <- ordered_genes[1:1000]

# Filter the data to include only the most variable genes
filtered_data <- data[top_1000_genes, ]

# Calculate the distance matrix between samples using the Euclidean distance
distance_matrix <- dist(filtered_data[, -1], method = "euclidean")

# Cluster the samples using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage
clusters <- hclust(distance_matrix, method = "complete")

# Cut the dendrogram into clusters
num_clusters <- 3  # Specify the number of clusters
cluster_labels <- cutree(clusters, k = num_clusters)

# Extract the cluster-specific genes
cluster_specific_genes <- lapply(unique(cluster_labels), function(cluster){
  genes_in_cluster <- which(cluster_labels == cluster)
  cluster_genes <- filtered_data[genes_in_cluster, ]
  cluster_genes
})

# Print the cluster-specific genes
for (i in 1:num_clusters) {
  cat("Cluster", i, "specific genes:\n")
  print(cluster_specific_genes[[i]])
}
```
