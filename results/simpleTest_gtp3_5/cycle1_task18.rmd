prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

# Read the metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt file
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Remove the first row
met_data <- met_data[-1, ]

# Read the subjects.txt file
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Get the dbGap IDs from the subject_data table
dbGapIDs <- subject_data[, 1]

# Subset the met_data table to include only the CpGs associated with Age
age_cpgs <- met_data[, c("CpG_id", dbGapIDs)]

# Check if the dbGap IDs column matches the first row of the met_data table
age_cpgs <- age_cpgs[, colnames(age_cpgs) %in% met_data[1, ]]

# Remove the dbGap IDs column
age_cpgs <- age_cpgs[, -1]

# Get the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
age_only_cpgs <- age_cpgs[!colnames(age_cpgs) %in% subject_data[, c("sex", "Race")], ]

# Get the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(age_only_cpgs, 20)

# Display the top 20 CpGs
print(top_20_cpgs)
