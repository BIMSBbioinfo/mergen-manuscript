prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Calculate the variance for each gene
variance <- apply(data, 1, var)

# Get the top 1000 most variable genes
top_genes <- names(sort(variance, decreasing = TRUE))[1:1000]

# Filter the data for the top genes
filtered_data <- data[top_genes, ]

# Plot heatmap with clustering of variable genes
heatmap(filtered_data, scale = "row", col = colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(100))

# Perform PCA on the samples
pca <- prcomp(t(filtered_data))

# Plot PCA results
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
```
This code reads the gene expression data from the "leukemiaExp.txt" file, calculates the variance for each gene, filters the gene expression data to retain the top 1000 most variable genes, and then plots a heatmap with clustering for these variable genes. Additionally, it performs PCA on the samples and plots the PCA results.
