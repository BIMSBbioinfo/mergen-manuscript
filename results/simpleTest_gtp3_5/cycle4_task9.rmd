prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
#install required packages





#load required libraries
library(reshape2)
library(ComplexHeatmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggfortify)

#read the gene expression data
gene_exp <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

#calculate the variance for each gene
variances <- apply(gene_exp, 1, var)

#sort the genes based on the variance
sorted_genes <- gene_exp[order(variances, decreasing = TRUE), ]

#select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_1000_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000, ]

#generate heatmap with clustering
heatmap(top_1000_genes, col = colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(50), scale = "column")

#perform PCA on the samples
pca <- prcomp(t(gene_exp))
pca_plot <- ggplot(data = as.data.frame(pca$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2")
pca_plot
```

Please make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the correct file name/path.
