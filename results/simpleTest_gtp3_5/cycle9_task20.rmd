prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

# Read count table

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

                              design = ~ group)

# Perform differential expression analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Get differentially expressed genes
res <- results(dds)

# Set significance threshold
sig_genes <- res$pvalue < 0.05

# Get group specific genes
group_specific_genes <- rownames(res)[sig_genes]

# Subset count table for group specific genes
count_table_specific <- count_table[group_specific_genes, ]

# Perform PCA using group specific genes
pca_data <- prcomp(t(count_table_specific[, -1]))

# Plot PCA
pca_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = pca_data$x, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = annotation_data$group)) +
  xlab("PC1") + ylab("PC2") +
  ggtitle("PCA plot") +
  theme_bw()

# Show PCA plot
print(pca_plot)

Please note that the code assumes that the count table and annotation data files are in the same directory as your R script (or working directory). You may need to modify the file paths accordingly if they are located in a different directory. Additionally, make sure to install and load the required libraries before running the code.
