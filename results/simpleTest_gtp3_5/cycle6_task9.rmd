prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
The code for the given task is as follows:

```
# Loading the required packages
library(gplots)
library(heatmap3)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(factoextra)

# Reading the gene expression data
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# Calculating the variance of genes
variance <- apply(data, 1, var)

# Sorting the genes based on variance in descending order
sorted_genes <- names(variance)[order(variance, decreasing = TRUE)]

# Selecting the top 1000 variable genes
top_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000]

# Subsetting the data with the top variable genes
subset_data <- data[top_genes, ]

# Creating a heatmap with clustering
heatmap3(subset_data, Colv = NA, scale = "row", main = "Heatmap with Clustering")

# Performing PCA on the data
pca_data <- prcomp(t(subset_data))
pca_df <- as.data.frame(pca_data$x)

# Plotting PCA
ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot for Samples")

```

Ensure that the "leukemiaExp.txt" file is present in the working directory before running this code.
