prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the count table
counts <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Retrieve the gene names
gene_names <- counts[, 1]

# Retrieve the sample names
sample_names <- colnames(counts)[2:(ncol(counts)-1)]

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", length(gene_names), "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", length(sample_names), "\n")
```
Note: Replace "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" with the correct file path if it is not in the current working directory.
