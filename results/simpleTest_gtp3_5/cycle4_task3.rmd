prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Load required library
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1 # Subtracting 1 because the first row contains gene names
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1 # Subtracting 1 because the first column contains gene names

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```
```
