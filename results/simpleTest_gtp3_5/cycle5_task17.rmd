prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Build a predictive model to predict Age from methylation values, and display most important variables for the predictive models. 

response:
```
# Read the methylation values table
methylation <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Read the subjects information table
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Obtain the common individuals between two datasets
common_individuals <- intersect(methylation$`dbGap ID`, subjects$`dbGap ID`)

# Subset the datasets with common individuals
methylation <- methylation[, c("dbGap ID", common_individuals)]
subjects <- subjects[subjects$`dbGap ID` %in% common_individuals, ]

# Rename the columns of the methylation table
colnames(methylation)[-1] <- methylation[1, -1]

# Remove the first row of methylation table
methylation <- methylation[-1, ]

# Convert the methylation values to numeric
methylation[, -1] <- lapply(methylation[, -1], as.numeric)

# Merge the methylation and subjects tables on dbGap ID
merged_data <- merge(methylation, subjects, by = "dbGap ID")

# Build a predictive model to predict Age from methylation values
model <- lm(Age ~ ., data = merged_data)

# Display the most important variables for the predictive models
summary(model)
```
Note: This code assumes that the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" files are in the current working directory. Adjust the file paths accordingly if they are located elsewhere.
