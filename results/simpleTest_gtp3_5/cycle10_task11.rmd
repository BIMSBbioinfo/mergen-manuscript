prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of rows and columns in met_data
met_rows <- nrow(met_data)
met_cols <- ncol(met_data)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of rows and columns in subjects_data
subjects_rows <- nrow(subjects_data)
subjects_cols <- ncol(subjects_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each dataset
print(paste("Number of rows and columns in met_data:", met_rows, "rows,", met_cols, "columns."))
print(paste("Number of rows and columns in subjects_data:", subjects_rows, "rows,", subjects_cols, "columns."))
```
