prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
gene_data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t")

# Count the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples)
num_genes <- nrow(gene_data)
num_samples <- ncol(gene_data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
num_genes
num_samples
```
The dataset has a total of `num_genes` genes and `num_samples` samples.
