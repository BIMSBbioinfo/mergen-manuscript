prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
```
# Read the tables
met_table <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count number of rows and columns for each table
met_rows <- nrow(met_table)
met_cols <- ncol(met_table)
subjects_rows <- nrow(subjects)
subjects_cols <- ncol(subjects)

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of rows in met_table:", met_rows))
print(paste("Number of columns in met_table:", met_cols))
print(paste("Number of rows in subjects:", subjects_rows))
print(paste("Number of columns in subjects:", subjects_cols))
```
Please note that you will need to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file names and make sure they are in the correct directory.
