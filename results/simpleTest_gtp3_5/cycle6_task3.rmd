prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples)
genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtracting 1 to exclude the header row
samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtracting 1 to exclude the gene names column

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", samples, "\n")
```
Output:
```
Number of genes: x
Number of samples: y
```
Replace 'x' and 'y' with the actual number of genes and samples in your dataset.
