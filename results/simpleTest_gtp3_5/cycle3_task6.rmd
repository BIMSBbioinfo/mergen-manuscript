prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read in the gene expression data
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# If there are more than 500 samples
if(ncol(gene_data) > 500) {
  # Randomly sample 500 columns
  sampled_data <- gene_data[, sample(colnames(gene_data), 500)]
} else {
  # Keep the data as it is
  sampled_data <- gene_data
}

# Print the sampled data
print(sampled_data)
```
Note: Replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file name/path.
