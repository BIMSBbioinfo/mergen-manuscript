prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
expression_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Check the number of columns (samples)
num_samples <- ncol(expression_data)

# Check if there are more than 500 samples
if (num_samples > 500) {
  # Set the desired number of samples
  desired_num_samples <- 500
  
  # Randomly sample the indices of the columns
  sampled_indices <- sample(1:num_samples, desired_num_samples, replace = FALSE)
  
  # Subset the data using the sampled indices
  sampled_expression_data <- expression_data[, sampled_indices]
  
  # Print the subsetted data
  sampled_expression_data
} else {
  # If there are less than or equal to 500 samples, no need to sample
  expression_data
}
```
