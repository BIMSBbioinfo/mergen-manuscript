prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
Here is the R code to read the excel file and determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset:

```
library(readxl)

# Set the file path of the excel sheet
file_path <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel(file_path)

# Count the number of genes and samples in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1   # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row with gene names
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of Genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of Samples:", num_samples))
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the correct file path and name if it is different in your case.
