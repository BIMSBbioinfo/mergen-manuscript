prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Load the required package
library(openxlsx)

# Read the excel file
data <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Dimension of the dataset
genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # -1 to exclude the header row
samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # -1 to exclude the first column

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of genes:", genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", samples))
```
