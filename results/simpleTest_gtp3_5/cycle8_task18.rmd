prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)

# Read the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Rename the first column of metRmOl to "CpG_id"
names(metRmOl)[1] <- "CpG_id"

# Join the datasets based on dbGap ID
data <- left_join(metRmOl, subjects, by = c("dbGap ID" = "dbGap ID"))

# Filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered_data <- filter(data, !is.na(Age) & is.na(sex) & is.na(Race))

# Order the filtered data by methylation values and select top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(arrange(filtered_data, desc(methylation_value)), 20)

# Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs
```
Note: Replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file paths or file names of your datasets.
