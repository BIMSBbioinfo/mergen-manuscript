prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
```
# Read the datasets
metRmOl <- read.delim("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
subjects <- read.delim("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Match the dbGap IDs between the two datasets
matched_ids <- match(subjects$dbGapID, metRmOl[1, ])

# Extract the relevant columns from the datasets
age <- subjects$Age[matched_ids]
sex <- subjects$sex[matched_ids]
race <- subjects$Race[matched_ids]
methylation <- metRmOl[-1, matched_ids]

# Find CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
cpgs <- rownames(methylation)[!is.na(age) & is.na(sex) & is.na(race)]

# Display top 20 CpGs
top_cpgs <- head(cpgs, 20)
top_cpgs
```
Note: Make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file paths, if they are different.
