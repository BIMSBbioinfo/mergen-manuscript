prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the data from the file
data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t")

# Get the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples)
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```
Note: Make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file path if it's in a different directory.
