prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Find the number of rows (genes) in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(gene_data)

# Find the number of columns (samples) in the dataset
num_samples <- ncol(gene_data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
