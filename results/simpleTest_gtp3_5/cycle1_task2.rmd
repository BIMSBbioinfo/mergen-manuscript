prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
gene_expression <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expression)
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expression)
# Print the results
cat("Number of genes in the dataset:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples in the dataset:", num_samples, "\n")
```
Output:
Number of genes in the dataset: [number of genes]
Number of samples in the dataset: [number of samples]
