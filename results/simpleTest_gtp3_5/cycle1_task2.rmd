prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the data from the file
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Count the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(gene_data)

# Count the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(gene_data) - 1   # Subtract 1 for the gene names column

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```
The dataset has X genes and X samples, where X is the actual number of genes and samples in the dataset.
