prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

# Load required libraries

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Extract sample names from annotation data
sample_names <- annotation_data$SampleID

# Set the row names of the count table as the gene names
rownames(count_table) <- count_table$Gene

# Remove the first column (gene names) from the count table
count_table <- count_table[, -1]

# Subset the count table to include only the samples present in the annotation data
count_table <- count_table[, sample_names]

# Create a DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table,
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~ 1)

# Perform normalization
dds_normalized <- DESeq(dds)

# Extract normalized counts
normalized_counts <- counts(dds_normalized, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA
pca_data <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Create a data frame with PCA results
pca_results <- data.frame(PC1 = pca_data$x[, 1],
                          PC2 = pca_data$x[, 2],
                          Group = annotation_data$group,
                          LibrarySelection = annotation_data$LibrarySelection)

ggplot(pca_results, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA plot of samples (Color coded by 'Group')") +
  theme_minimal()

# Plot PCA color coded by LibrarySelection

Note: Make sure to install the required libraries (`DESeq2`, `ggplot2`, `readxl`) before executing the code.
