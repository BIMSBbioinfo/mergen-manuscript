prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
Here is the R code to perform the tasks mentioned:

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)
library(apeglm)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Set the row names of count table as gene names
rownames(count_table) <- count_table$GeneNames
count_table <- count_table[, -1]  # Remove the first column (gene names)

# Normalize counts using DESeq2
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table, colData = annotation_data, design = ~ 1)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA analysis
pca_data <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))
pca_df <- as.data.frame(pca_data$x)

# Create a plot color-coded by "group"
plot(pca_df$PC1, pca_df$PC2, col = annotation_data$group)

# Create a plot color-coded by "LibrarySelection"
plot(pca_df$PC1, pca_df$PC2, col = annotation_data$LibrarySelection)
```
Please note that the above code assumes that you have installed the required libraries (readxl, DESeq2, apeglm). Additionally, make sure that you provide the correct file paths for the count table and annotation data.
