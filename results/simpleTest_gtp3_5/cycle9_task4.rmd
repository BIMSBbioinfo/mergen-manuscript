prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
Note: This assumes that the gene names are present in the first column, and the gene length is present in the last column of the count table. You may need to adjust the column indices (-2) based on the actual structure of your count table.
