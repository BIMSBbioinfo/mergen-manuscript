prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data. Create a boxplot of the columns

response:
```
# Read the data from the file
gene_expression <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t")

# Check the number of columns in the data
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expression)

# If more than 500 samples, randomly sample 500 samples
if(num_samples > 500) {
  # Set seed for reproducibility
  set.seed(123)
  # Randomly select 500 sample indices
  sample_indices <- sample(num_samples, size = 500)
  # Create subset of data using the selected sample indices
  gene_expression_subset <- gene_expression[, sample_indices]
} else {
  # If less than or equal to 500 samples, use the entire data
  gene_expression_subset <- gene_expression
}

# Create boxplot of the columns in the subset of data
boxplot(gene_expression_subset)
```
```
