prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
The code below reads in the two datasets, matches the individuals based on their DBGap ID, and filters the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race. The top 20 CpGs are then displayed.

```
# Read in the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Match individuals based on DBGap ID
matched <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Find CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
assoc_cpgs <- names(matched)[grepl("CpG", names(matched))]
age_assoc_cpgs <- assoc_cpgs[apply(matched[, assoc_cpgs], 1, function(x) any(!is.na(x) & !is.na(matched$Age)))]
sex_assoc_cpgs <- assoc_cpgs[apply(matched[, assoc_cpgs], 1, function(x) any(!is.na(x) & !is.na(matched$sex)))]
race_assoc_cpgs <- assoc_cpgs[apply(matched[, assoc_cpgs], 1, function(x) any(!is.na(x) & !is.na(matched$Race)))]
age_only_cpgs <- age_assoc_cpgs[!(age_assoc_cpgs %in% sex_assoc_cpgs | age_assoc_cpgs %in% race_assoc_cpgs)]

# Display top 20 CpGs associated with Age only
top_20_age_cpgs <- head(age_only_cpgs, 20)
top_20_age_cpgs
```

Note: This code assumes that the datasets are stored in the current working directory. Make sure to adjust the file paths if necessary.
