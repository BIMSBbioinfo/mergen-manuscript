prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Build a predictive model to predict Age from methylation values, and display most important variables for the predictive models.

# Load necessary libraries

# Read the datasets
metRmOl <- fread("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt")
subjects <- fread("subjects.txt")

# Transpose the metRmOl dataset to have individuals as rows and CpG as columns
metRmOl <- t(metRmOl)

# Remove the first row (DBGapId) from metRmOl dataset
metRmOl <- metRmOl[-1, ]

# Set the column names of metRmOl as the first row
colnames(metRmOl) <- metRmOl[1, ]
metRmOl <- metRmOl[-1, ]

# Convert the Age column in subjects to numeric
subjects$Age <- as.numeric(subjects$Age)

# Match the DBGapId column in subjects with the column names in metRmOl
metRmOl <- metRmOl[, colnames(metRmOl) %in% subjects$`dbGap ID`]

# Combine subjects and metRmOl datasets based on DBGapId
combined_data <- cbind(subjects, metRmOl)

# Convert the variables to appropriate types
combined_data$Age <- as.numeric(combined_data$Age)
combined_data[, -c(1:2)] <- as.numeric(as.matrix(combined_data[, -c(1:2)]))

# Split the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(combined_data$Age, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
train_data <- combined_data[trainIndex, ]
test_data <- combined_data[-trainIndex, ]

# Train a random forest model to predict Age using methylation values
rf_model <- randomForest(Age ~ ., data = train_data)

# Display the variable importance of the random forest model
varImpPlot(rf_model)

Note: The code assumes that both datasets are in the same directory as the R script. Please modify the file paths if necessary.
