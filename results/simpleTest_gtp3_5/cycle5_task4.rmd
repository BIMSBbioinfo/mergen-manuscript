prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the count table from the file
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Count the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2 # Subtracting 2 to exclude the gene name and length columns

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```
Note: Replace `"SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv"` with the actual file path if it is different from the current working directory.
