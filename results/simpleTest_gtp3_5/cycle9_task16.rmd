prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", delim = "\t")

# Rename first column of annotation data
colnames(annotation_data)[1] <- "sample_id"

# Merge count table and annotation data
merged_data <- inner_join(count_table, annotation_data, by = "sample_id")

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample
plot <- merged_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(sample_id, group), names_to = "gene", values_to = "expression_value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample_id, y = expression_value, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Sample ID", y = "Expression Value", fill = "Group")

# Display the plot
plot
```
Please make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the appropriate file paths for your system.
