prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Check the dimensions of the data
genes <- nrow(data) - 1 # Exclude the first row (gene names row)
samples <- ncol(data) - 1 # Exclude the first column (gene names column)

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", samples, "\n")
```
Number of genes: [number of genes]
Number of samples: [number of samples]

Please note that you need to replace "[number of genes]" and "[number of samples]" in the output with the actual numbers obtained from running the code.
