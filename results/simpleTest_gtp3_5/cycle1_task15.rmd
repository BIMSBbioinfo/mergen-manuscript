prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Read the data and merge them into a single table using dbGapId information. Plot a scatter plot of CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects in the samples.

response:
```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Merge the two datasets based on dbGap ID
merged_data <- merge(met_data, subjects_data, by.x = "DBGapId", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Get the two oldest subjects
oldest_subjects <- merged_data[order(merged_data$Age, decreasing = TRUE), ][1:2, ]

# Scatter plot of CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects
plot(oldest_subjects$CpG_id, oldest_subjects[, 2:ncol(oldest_subjects)],
     xlab = "CpG ID", ylab = "Methylation Value", main = "Scatter plot of CpG Methylation")
legend("bottomright", legend = oldest_subjects$DBGapId, fill = 1:2)
```
