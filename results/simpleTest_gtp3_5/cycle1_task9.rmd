prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

# Read the gene expression data
gene_exp <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Calculate the variability of each gene
gene_variability <- apply(gene_exp, 1, var)

# Get the top 1000 most variable genes
top_var_genes <- names(sort(gene_variability, decreasing = TRUE))[1:1000]

# Subset the gene expression data with the top variable genes
gene_exp_filtered <- gene_exp[top_var_genes, ]

# Perform hierarchical clustering and plot heatmap
heatmap_data <- t(scale(gene_exp_filtered))
heatmap_cluster <- hclust(dist(heatmap_data))
heatmap_colors <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9, "RdBu"))(256)
heatmap_cluster_ordered <- cutree(heatmap_cluster, k = length(unique(heatmap_cluster$order)))
heatmap(plot(heatmap_cluster_ordered))

# Perform PCA and plot
pca_data <- prcomp(t(gene_exp_filtered))
