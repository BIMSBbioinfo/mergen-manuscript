prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Calculate the variance of each gene
gene_var <- apply(data, 1, var)

# Sort the genes based on their variance in descending order
sorted_genes <- names(gene_var)[order(gene_var, decreasing=TRUE)]

# Select the top 1000 genes with the highest variance
top_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000]

# Filter the gene expression data to retain only the top 1000 genes
filtered_data <- data[top_genes, ]

# Perform clustering and plot the heatmap
library(gplots)
heatmap.2(filtered_data, trace="none", dendrogram="both", main="Gene Expression Heatmap")

# Perform PCA and plot the result
pca_result <- prcomp(filtered_data, scale=TRUE)
plot(pca_result$x, main="PCA Plot for Gene Expression Data")
```
Note: Make sure to load the necessary libraries before running the code.
