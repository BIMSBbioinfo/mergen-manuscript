prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Read the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Transpose the metRmOl dataset
metRmOl <- t(metRmOl)

# Rename the first row of the metRmOl dataset with the column names from subjects dataset
colnames(metRmOl) <- subjects$dbGap_ID

# Filter CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered_cpgs <- metRmOl %>% 
  filter(row.names(.) %in% colnames(subjects) & 
           colnames(.) %in% subjects$dbGap_ID & 
           !colnames(.) %in% c("sex", "Race")) %>%
  select(row.names(.))

# Display top 20 CpGs
top20_cpgs <- head(filtered_cpgs, 20)

# Print the top 20 CpGs
print(top20_cpgs)
```
Note: Replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file paths of the datasets in your local machine.
