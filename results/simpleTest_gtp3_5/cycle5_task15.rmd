prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Read the data and merge them into a single table using dbGapId information. Plot a scatter plot of CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects in the samples.

response:
```
# Read the data from "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt"
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Merge the data using dbGapId information
merged_data <- merge(met_data, subjects_data, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGapId")

# Find the two oldest subjects
oldest_subjects <- merged_data[order(merged_data$Age, decreasing = TRUE), ][1:2, ]

# Plot scatter plot of CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects
plot(oldest_subjects[, -ncol(oldest_subjects)], type = "p", pch = 19,
     xlab = "CpG", ylab = "Methylation Values")
```
