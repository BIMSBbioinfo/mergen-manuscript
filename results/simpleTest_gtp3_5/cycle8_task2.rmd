prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the data from the file
data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# Get the number of samples
num_samp <- ncol(data)

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samp, "\n")
```
