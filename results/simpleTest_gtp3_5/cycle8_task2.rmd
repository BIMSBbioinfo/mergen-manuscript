prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the data file
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(gene_data)

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(gene_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column with gene names

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
