prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes cluster the samples, and extract cluster specific genes for each cluster.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Calculate the gene variability
variance <- apply(data[, -1], 1, var)

# Get the indices of the top 1000 genes with highest variability
top_1000_genes <- order(variance, decreasing = TRUE)[1:1000]

# Filter the data to retain only the top 1000 genes
filtered_data <- data[c(top_1000_genes + 1), ]

# Perform hierarchical clustering on the samples
dist_matrix <- dist(t(filtered_data[, -1]))
hc <- hclust(dist_matrix)
clusters <- cutree(hc, k = 5)  # Assuming we want to cluster samples into 5 clusters

# Extract cluster-specific genes for each cluster
cluster_specific_genes <- list()
for (i in 1:max(clusters)) {
  cluster_samples <- which(clusters == i)
  cluster_expression <- filtered_data[, cluster_samples + 1]
  # Calculate the gene variability within the cluster
  cluster_variance <- apply(cluster_expression, 1, var)
  # Get the indices of the top 100 genes with highest variability within the cluster
  top_100_genes <- order(cluster_variance, decreasing = TRUE)[1:100]
  # Store the cluster-specific genes
  cluster_specific_genes[[i]] <- rownames(cluster_expression)[top_100_genes]
}

# Print the cluster-specific genes for each cluster
for (i in 1:max(clusters)) {
  cat("Cluster", i, "specific genes:\n")
  cat(cluster_specific_genes[[i]], "\n\n")
}
```
