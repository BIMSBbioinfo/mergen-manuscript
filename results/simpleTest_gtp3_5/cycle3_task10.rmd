prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes cluster the samples, and extract cluster specific genes for each cluster.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Calculate the variance for each gene
variances <- apply(data[, -1], 1, var)

# Sort the genes based on their variance in descending order
sorted_genes <- sort(variances, decreasing = TRUE)

# Select the top 1000 genes with the highest variance
top_genes <- names(sorted_genes)[1:1000]

# Filter the data to retain only the top variable genes
filtered_data <- data[c("gene", top_genes)]

# Perform hierarchical clustering on the samples
distances <- dist(filtered_data[, -1]) # Calculate distance matrix
hclust_res <- hclust(distances) # Perform hierarchical clustering
clusters <- cutree(hclust_res, k = 5) # Assign samples to clusters

# Extract cluster-specific genes for each cluster
cluster_genes <- lapply(1:max(clusters), function(i) {
  cluster_samples <- which(clusters == i) # Get samples belonging to the cluster
  # Find the genes that are differentially expressed in the cluster
  top_cluster_genes <- names(sort(apply(filtered_data[, cluster_samples], 1, var), decreasing = TRUE))[1:100]
  return(top_cluster_genes)
})

# Print the cluster-specific genes for each cluster
for(i in 1:length(cluster_genes)) {
  cat("Cluster", i, "genes:\n")
  cat(cluster_genes[[i]], "\n\n")
}
```
Note: This code assumes that the first column of the "leukemiaExp.txt" file contains the gene names and the remaining columns contain the sample data. Adjustments may be needed if the structure of the input file is different.
