prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

# Load necessary libraries
library(DESeq2)

library(ggplot2)

# Read count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)
count_table <- as.matrix(count_table)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Create DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table, colData = annotation_data, design = ~ group)

# Perform size factor normalization
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)

# Normalize counts
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for samples color coded by "group"
pca_group <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))
pca_group_df <- data.frame(x = pca_group$x[,1], y = pca_group$x[,2], group = dds$group)
ggplot(pca_group_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = group)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal()

# Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for samples color coded by "LibrarySelection"
pca_library <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))
pca_library_df <- data.frame(x = pca_library$x[,1], y = pca_library$x[,2], LibrarySelection = dds$LibrarySelection)
ggplot(pca_library_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = LibrarySelection)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal()

Note: Please make sure to install and load the necessary libraries before running the code. You can install them using the `install.packages()` function.
