prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

# Read count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1, header = TRUE) 

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Extract sample ids from annotation data
sample_ids <- annotation_data$sample_id

# Subset count table to include only the samples present in the annotation data
count_table <- count_table[, sample_ids]

# Normalize counts using the voom function from the limma package
library(limma)
normalized_counts <- voom(count_table)

# Perform PCA on the normalized counts

# Transpose the normalized counts matrix

# Perform PCA
pca <- prcomp(normalized_counts_transposed)

# Plot PCA color coded by "group" in the annotation data
group_colors <- annotation_data$group
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col = group_colors, pch = 16, xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
