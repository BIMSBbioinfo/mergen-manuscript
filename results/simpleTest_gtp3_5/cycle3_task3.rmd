prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
#install package


# load library
library(readxl)

# read excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1   # subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1 # subtract 1 to exclude the first column

num_genes
num_samples
```
```
The code above uses the "readxl" package to read the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" file. It then calculates the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the number of rows (excluding the header row) and the number of samples by subtracting 1 from the number of columns (excluding the first column). The resulting values are stored in the variables `num_genes` and `num_samples`, respectively.
