prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
# Read the data from the file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Calculate the variance for each gene
variance <- apply(data[, -1], 1, var)

# Sort the genes based on variance in descending order
sorted_genes <- data[order(variance, decreasing = TRUE), ]

# Select the top 1000 genes with highest variance
top_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000, ]

# Remove the gene names column
selected_genes <- top_genes[, -1]

# Calculate the z-scores for the selected genes
z_scores <- scale(selected_genes)

# Plot the heatmap with clustering
heatmap(z_scores, Colv = NA)

# Perform PCA on the data
pca <- prcomp(selected_genes)

# Plot the PCA
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
```
Please note that you need to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file path/name of your gene expression data file.
