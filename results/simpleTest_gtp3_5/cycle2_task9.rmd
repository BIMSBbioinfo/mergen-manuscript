prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
# Read in the gene expression data
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Calculate the variance of each gene
gene_var <- apply(gene_data, 1, var)

# Sort the genes by variance in descending order
sorted_genes <- gene_data[order(gene_var, decreasing=TRUE),]

# Select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000,]

# Perform clustering and plot heatmap
heatmap(as.matrix(top_genes), Colv=NA, scale="row")

# Perform PCA and plot
pca <- prcomp(t(top_genes))
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], xlab="PC1", ylab="PC2")
```
Note: Make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the correct file path to your data file.
