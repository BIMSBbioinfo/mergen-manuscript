prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Read the count table from the Excel file
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Rename the first column of the annotation data to match with sample IDs in count table
colnames(annotation_data)[1] <- "SampleID"

# Merge count table and annotation data using common sample IDs
merged_data <- count_table %>% 
  left_join(annotation_data, by = "SampleID")

# Calculate the number of columns in the merged data
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
print(num_columns)
```
```
