prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt".The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. 

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep="\t")

# Calculate the column-wise variance of the gene expression
variance <- apply(gene_data[, -1], 2, var)

# Sort the variance in descending order
sorted_variance <- sort(variance, decreasing = TRUE)

# Get the top 1000 genes with highest variance
top_genes <- gene_data[c(names(sorted_variance)[1:1000], 1)]

```
Note: Replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file path of your gene expression data file.
