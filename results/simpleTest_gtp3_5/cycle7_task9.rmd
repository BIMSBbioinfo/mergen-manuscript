prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
leukemiaExp <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Calculate the variability of each gene
gene_variability <- apply(leukemiaExp[, -1], 1, var)

# Sort genes based on variability in descending order
sorted_genes <- names(gene_variability)[order(-gene_variability)]

# Select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_1000_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000]

# Filter the gene expression data to keep only the most variable genes
filtered_exp <- leukemiaExp[c("GeneName", top_1000_genes)]

# Calculate the z-scores for each gene across the samples
scaled_exp <- scale(filtered_exp[, -1])

# Perform hierarchical clustering
hc <- hclust(dist(scaled_exp), method = "complete")

# Plot the heatmap with clustering
heatmap(scaled_exp, Colv = as.dendrogram(hc))

# Perform PCA on the filtered gene expression data
pca <- prcomp(filtered_exp[, -1])

# Plot the PCA
plot(pca$x)
```
