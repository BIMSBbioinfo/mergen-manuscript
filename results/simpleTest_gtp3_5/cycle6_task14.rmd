prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the data and merge them into a single table using dbGapId information, return the number of columns.

response:
```
# Read the 'metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt' file
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Read the 'subjects.txt' file
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Merge the two datasets based on dbGapId information
merged_data <- merge(met_data, subjects_data, by.x = "dbGapId", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Get the number of columns in the merged dataset
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```
Alternatively, if the files are located in different directories, you can specify the full file paths while reading them:
```
# Read the 'metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt' file
met_data <- read.table("/path/to/metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Read the 'subjects.txt' file
subjects_data <- read.table("/path/to/subjects.txt", header = TRUE)
```
