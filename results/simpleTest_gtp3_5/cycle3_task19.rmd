prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Extract the sample IDs from the annotation data
sample_ids <- annotation_data[,1]

# Set the sample IDs as column names in the count table
colnames(count_table) <- sample_ids

# Create a DESeqDataSet object for normalization
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table,
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~1)

# Perform the normalization using DESeq2
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Obtain normalized counts
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA on the normalized counts
pca_data <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Create PCA plot color coded by "group"
plot(pca_data$x[,1:2], col = annotation_data$group, pch = 16, xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")

# Create PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection"
plot(pca_data$x[,1:2], col = annotation_data$LibrarySelection, pch = 16, xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
```
Note: Replace the file paths "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths on your system.
