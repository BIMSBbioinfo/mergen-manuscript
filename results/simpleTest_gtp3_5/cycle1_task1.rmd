prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

response:
```
# Read the file
data <- read.delim("subjects.txt", sep = "\t")

# Get the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_columns <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of rows and columns
cat("Number of rows:", num_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns:", num_columns, "\n")
```
Please make sure to replace "subjects.txt" with the correct file path if the file is not in the current working directory.
