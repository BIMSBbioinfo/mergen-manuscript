prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merge annotation data and count table based on sample ids
merged_data <- inner_join(annotation_data, count_table, by = "sample_id")

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = gene_expression_value)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "blue")) # Color code boxplots based on "group" variable

```
Note: Replace "gene_expression_value" with the appropriate column name in the count table.
