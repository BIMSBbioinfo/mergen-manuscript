prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
```
# Read the first dataset
data1 <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count number of rows and columns for data1
num_rows_data1 <- nrow(data1)
num_cols_data1 <- ncol(data1)

# Read the second dataset
data2 <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count number of rows and columns for data2
num_rows_data2 <- nrow(data2)
num_cols_data2 <- ncol(data2)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each dataset
num_rows_data1
num_cols_data1
num_rows_data2
num_cols_data2
```
```
