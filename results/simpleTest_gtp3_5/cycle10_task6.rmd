prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t")

# Check the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# If there are more than 500 samples
if (num_samples > 500) {
  # Randomly sample 500 samples
  set.seed(123)  # Set a seed for reproducibility
  sampled_data <- data[, sample(num_samples, 500)]
} else {
  sampled_data <- data  # Keep the original data if there are 500 or less samples
}

# View the subsetted data
head(sampled_data)
```
Note: Replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the correct file path/name if it is different in your case.
