prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Check the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Check if there are more than 500 samples
if (num_samples > 500) {
  # Randomly sample 500 samples
  sample_cols <- sample(2:num_samples, size = 500, replace = FALSE)
  
  # Create subset of the data with the sampled columns
  subset_data <- data[, c(1, sample_cols)]
  
  # Print the subset data
  print(subset_data)
} else {
  # Print the original data
  print(data)
}
```
```
