prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", delim = "\t")

# Rename the first column in the annotation data
colnames(annotation_data)[1] <- "Sample_ID"

# Merge annotation data and count table
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = "Sample_ID", all.x = TRUE)

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```
```

Note:
- Make sure the necessary libraries are installed and loaded before running the code (library(readxl), library(tidyverse)).
- Replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the correct file paths if they are in a different directory.
- The code assumes that the gene names in the first column of the count table match the sample ids in the annotation data.
