prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
```
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Get sample ids from annotation data
sample_ids <- annotation_data$Sample_id

# Merge annotation data and count table by matching sample ids
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "Sample_id", by.y = "Gene", all.x = TRUE)

# Calculate number of columns in the merged data
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
print(num_columns)
```
Note: Make sure to install and load the necessary libraries if they are not already installed.
