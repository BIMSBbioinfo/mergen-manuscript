prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Get the number of genes by counting the rows
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# Get the number of samples by counting the columns
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
num_genes
num_samples
```
```
