prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Check the dimensions of the data
genes <- nrow(data)
samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
genes
samples
```
The above code reads the gene expression data from the "leukemiaExp.txt" file using the `read.table()` function. It assumes that the file is tab-separated and has a header row. 

We then use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions to determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, respectively. Finally, we print the results to obtain the number of genes and samples in the dataset.
