prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data
geneExpr <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Calculate the variance for each gene
variance <- apply(geneExpr, 1, var)

# Sort the genes based on variance in descending order
sortedGenes <- names(variance)[order(variance, decreasing = TRUE)]

# Select the top 1000 genes with highest variance
top1000Genes <- sortedGenes[1:1000]

# Subset the gene expression data with the top 1000 genes
geneExprTop1000 <- geneExpr[top1000Genes, ]

# Perform clustering and plot a heatmap
heatmap(as.matrix(geneExprTop1000), scale = "row", Colv = NA)

# Perform PCA on the gene expression data
pca <- prcomp(geneExpr)

# Plot the PCA results for samples
plot(pca$x[, 1], pca$x[, 2], xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
```
Note: Replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file path of the gene expression data file.
