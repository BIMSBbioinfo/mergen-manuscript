prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
```
# Load necessary libraries
library(gplots)
library(pvclust)
library(heatmap3)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the gene expression data from the file
gene_expression <- read.table(file = "leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Filter genes based on variability
var_genes <- gene_expression[apply(gene_expression, 1, var) > quantile(apply(gene_expression, 1, var), 0.95), ]

# Select the top 1000 most variable genes
var_genes <- var_genes[order(apply(var_genes, 1, var), decreasing = TRUE)[1:1000], ]

# Create a heatmap with clustering using the variable genes
heatmap3(var_genes, Colv = NA, scale = "row", ColSideColors = c(rep(2, ncol(var_genes) / 2), rep(3, ncol(var_genes) / 2)))

# Perform PCA on the samples
pca <- prcomp(t(gene_expression))

# Plot PCA for samples
ggplot(data = as.data.frame(pca$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```
This code reads the gene expression data from the file "leukemiaExp.txt" and filters the genes based on their variability. It retains the most variable top 1000 genes and then creates a heatmap with clustering using these variable genes. Additionally, it performs PCA on the samples and plots a PCA plot using the first two principal components.
