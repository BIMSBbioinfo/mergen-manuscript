prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample.  If there are more samples than 500 then randomly sample the samples column and create a subset of the data

response:
```
# Read the gene expression data from file
data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t")

# Check the number of columns (samples)
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Check if there are more than 500 samples
if (num_samples > 500) {
  # Randomly sample 500 samples
  sampled_columns <- sample(colnames(data), 500)
  
  # Create subset of the data using the sampled columns
  subset_data <- data[, sampled_columns]
  
  # View the subset data
  subset_data
} else {
  # If there are less than or equal to 500 samples, no need to subset
  data
}
```
