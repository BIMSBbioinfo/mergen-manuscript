prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Install and load the 'readxl' package for reading Excel files

library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file containing gene expression data
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Calculate the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
```

Alternatively, if you have the data already stored in a data frame object called `data`, you can omit the first two lines of code that install and load the 'readxl' package and directly use the rest of the code.
