prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Extract the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1        # Subtract 1 to exclude gene names row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1      # Subtract 1 to exclude gene names column

# Print the number of genes and samples
num_genes
num_samples
```
```
The code above reads the excel file using the `read_excel` function from the `readxl` package. It then calculates the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the total number of rows, excluding the row containing gene names. The number of samples is calculated by subtracting 1 from the total number of columns, excluding the column containing gene names. Finally, the code prints the number of genes and samples.
