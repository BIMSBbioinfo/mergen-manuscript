prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, we can use the `merge()` function in R. Assuming that both the count table and annotation file are in the same directory, we can proceed with the following steps:

1. Load the necessary libraries:
```
library(openxlsx)  # for reading Excel files
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data:
```
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", startRow = 1)
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
```

3. Perform the merge based on the sample IDs:
```
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by = "SampleID")
```

4. Calculate the number of columns in the merged data:
```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

Here is the complete code block:
```
library(openxlsx)

count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", startRow = 1)
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by = "SampleID")

num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```
