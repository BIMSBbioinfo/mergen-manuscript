prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, we need to read both files, match the sample IDs, and then combine the data into a single table. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load required libraries
library(openxlsx)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1, startRow = 1, colNames = TRUE)
# Transpose the count table to match the annotation data structure
count_table <- t(count_table)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Match and merge the annotation data with the count table
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = "row.names")

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```

Please make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths or provide the files in the working directory.

Note: This code assumes that the sample ID column in the annotation data is named "sample_id" and the row names in the count table correspond to the sample IDs. If the column names or structure of your files are different, please adjust the code accordingly.
