prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we will make use of the `readxl` package in R to read the gene expression data from the Excel file and then extract the relevant information.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install and load the necessary packages

library(readxl)

# Read the gene expression data from the Excel file
gene_expression_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns)
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expression_data)
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expression_data)

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples)
```

Make sure you have the `readxl` package installed by running `` if you haven't done so already.

Note: Replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the actual file path to your Excel file.

The code reads the gene expression data using the `read_excel()` function and stores it in the `gene_expression_data` dataframe. Then, the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the dataframe are obtained using `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions, respectively. Finally, the results are printed using `cat()` function.
