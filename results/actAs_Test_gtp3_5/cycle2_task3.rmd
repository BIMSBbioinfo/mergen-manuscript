prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the gene expression dataset, we can use the `read_excel` function from the `readxl` package in R. Here's how you can do it:

```
# Install and load the required packages

library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
gene_exp_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(gene_exp_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(gene_exp_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column

# Print the result
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

This code reads the gene expression data from the Excel file and stores it in the `gene_exp_data` data frame. Then, it calculates the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the total number of rows, and the number of samples by subtracting 1 from the total number of columns. Finally, it prints the results.
