prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To count the number of genes and samples in the excel sheet "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", we can use the `readxl` library in R to read the data and then use the `dim()` function to get the dimensions of the data frame.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load the required library
library(readxl)

# Read the excel sheet
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- dim(data)[1]

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- dim(data)[2] - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the gene name column

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the appropriate file path or name if it's in the same directory as your R script.
