prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the excel sheet and then extract the required information.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install and load the required package

library(readxl)

# Specify the file path of the excel sheet
file_path <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"

# Read the excel sheet
data <- read_excel(file_path)

# Fetch the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the gene names column

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

Make sure to update the `file_path` variable with the actual file path of your excel sheet. Running the above code will print the number of genes and samples in the dataset.
