prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables, count the number of rows and columns for each dataset, you can use the R programming language. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count number of rows and columns
num_rows_met <- nrow(met_data)
num_cols_met <- ncol(met_data)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count number of rows and columns
num_rows_subjects <- nrow(subjects_data)
num_cols_subjects <- ncol(subjects_data)

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows and columns in 'metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt':", "\n")
cat("Rows:", num_rows_met, "\n")
cat("Columns:", num_cols_met, "\n")

cat("\n")

cat("Number of rows and columns in 'subjects.txt':", "\n")
cat("Rows:", num_rows_subjects, "\n")
cat("Columns:", num_cols_subjects, "\n")
```

This code reads the two datasets using the `read.table()` function. It then counts the number of rows and columns in each dataset using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions. Finally, the results are printed to the console using the `cat()` function.

Note: Make sure to replace the file names and file paths in the `read.table()` function with the correct values for your specific case.
