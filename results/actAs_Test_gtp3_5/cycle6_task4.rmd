prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the count table file, count the number of columns excluding the first and last column, and count the number of rows in the file. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load required packages
library(data.table)

# Read the count table
count_table <- fread("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv")

# Count the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Count the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples)
```

Make sure to replace "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" with the correct file path of your count table.
