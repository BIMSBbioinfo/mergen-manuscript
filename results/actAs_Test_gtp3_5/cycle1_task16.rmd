prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, you can use the `read_excel` and `read.table` functions in R to read the count table and annotation data respectively. Then, you can merge the two datasets based on the sample IDs. Finally, you can use the `ggplot2` package to create boxplots and color code them based on the "group" variable in the annotation data. Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Merge annotation data and count table
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "Sample_ID", by.y = "Sample", all.x = TRUE)

# Plot boxplots
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = Gene)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "blue")) +
  xlab("Group") +
  ylab("Gene Expression") +
  ggtitle("Gene Expression Boxplots per Sample")
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the actual file path of your count table, and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the file path of your annotation data. Additionally, adjust the aesthetics and titles in the `ggplot` function as per your preference.
