prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To find the number of genes and samples in the excel sheet, we can use the R programming language and the `readxl` package to read the data from the excel file. Here's the code to accomplish this:

```
# Install and load the readxl package

library(readxl)

# Set the file path to the excel sheet
file_path <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"

# Read the excel sheet into a data frame
data <- read_excel(file_path)

# Find the number of genes (number of rows excluding the first row)
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1

# Find the number of samples (number of columns excluding the first column)
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

This code assumes that the excel sheet has column headers and row headers, with the gene names in the first column. It calculates the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the total number of rows in the data frame (`nrow(data)`). Similarly, it calculates the number of samples by subtracting 1 from the total number of columns (`ncol(data)`).

Please make sure to install the `readxl` package before running the code by uncommenting ``.
