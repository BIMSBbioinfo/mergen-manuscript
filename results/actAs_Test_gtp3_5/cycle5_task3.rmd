prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To find the number of genes and samples in the gene expression dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then calculate the dimensions of the resulting matrix.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load the readxl package
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1   # Exclude the first row (gene names)
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1 # Exclude the first column (gene names)

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the correct file path to your Excel file.

This code reads the Excel file using `read_excel()` function and assigns it to the `data` variable. Then, it calculates the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the number of rows (excluding the first row containing gene names) and the number of samples by subtracting 1 from the number of columns (excluding the first column containing gene names). Finally, it prints the results using the `cat()` function.
