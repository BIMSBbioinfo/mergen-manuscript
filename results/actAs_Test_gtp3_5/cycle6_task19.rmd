prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the R programming language and several bioinformatics and data analysis packages, such as `edgeR`, `DESeq2`, and `ggplot2`. Here are the steps to normalize the counts, create the PCA plots, and color code them based on "group" and "LibrarySelection":

1. First, install and load the required packages:
```

library(edgeR)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data:
```
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")
```

3. Normalize the counts using the TMM (trimmed mean of M-values) method in the `edgeR` package:
```
y <- DGEList(counts = count_table)
y <- calcNormFactors(y)
norm_counts <- cpm(y, log = TRUE, prior.count = 0.25)
```

4. Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the normalized counts:
```
pca <- prcomp(t(norm_counts))
```

5. Create the first PCA plot color coded by "group" in the annotation data:
```
pca_plot_group <- ggplot(data.frame(PC1 = pca$x[, 1], PC2 = pca$x[, 2], group = annotation_data$group), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color coded by group)")
print(pca_plot_group)
```

6. Create the second PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection" in the annotation data:
```
pca_plot_library <- ggplot(data.frame(PC1 = pca$x[, 1], PC2 = pca$x[, 2], library_selection = annotation_data$LibrarySelection), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = library_selection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color coded by LibrarySelection)")
print(pca_plot_library)
```

Here is the complete code:
```

library(edgeR)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

y <- DGEList(counts = count_table)
y <- calcNormFactors(y)
norm_counts <- cpm(y, log = TRUE, prior.count = 0.25)

pca <- prcomp(t(norm_counts))

pca_plot_group <- ggplot(data.frame(PC1 = pca$x[, 1], PC2 = pca$x[, 2], group = annotation_data$group), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color coded by group)")

pca_plot_library <- ggplot(data.frame(PC1 = pca$x[, 1], PC2 = pca$x[, 2], library_selection = annotation_data$LibrarySelection), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = library_selection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color coded by LibrarySelection)")

print(pca_plot_group)
print(pca_plot_library)
```

Please make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths to your datasets.
