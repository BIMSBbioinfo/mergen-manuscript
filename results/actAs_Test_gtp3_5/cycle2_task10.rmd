prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes cluster the samples, and extract cluster specific genes for each cluster.

response:
To complete this task, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Read the gene expression data from the file "leukemiaExp.txt".
2. Calculate the variability of each gene.
3. Sort the genes based on their variability and select the top 1000 most variable genes.
4. Perform clustering analysis on the selected genes to cluster the samples.
5. Identify cluster-specific genes for each cluster.

Here's the code to accomplish these steps:

```
# Step 1: Read gene expression data
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Step 2: Calculate gene variability
gene_variability <- apply(gene_data[, -1], 1, var)

# Step 3: Select top 1000 most variable genes
top_genes <- head(sort(gene_variability, decreasing = TRUE), 1000)

# Step 4: Perform clustering analysis
library(cluster)

# Calculate dissimilarity matrix using Euclidean distance
diss_matrix <- dist(gene_data[, -1], method = "euclidean")

# Perform hierarchical clustering using complete linkage method
hclust_result <- hclust(diss_matrix, method = "complete")

# Cut the dendrogram into clusters
num_clusters <- 5 # Assuming we want 5 clusters
cluster_labels <- cutree(hclust_result, k = num_clusters)

# Step 5: Identify cluster-specific genes
cluster_specific_genes <- list()

for (i in 1:num_clusters) {
  # Get indices of samples in current cluster
  cluster_indices <- which(cluster_labels == i)
  
  # Subset the gene data for samples in current cluster
  cluster_genes <- gene_data[cluster_indices, ]
  
  # Calculate gene variability for the cluster
  cluster_gene_variability <- apply(cluster_genes[, -1], 1, var)
  
  # Select top 100 variable genes for the cluster
  cluster_specific_genes[[i]] <- rownames(head(sort(cluster_gene_variability, decreasing = TRUE), 100))
}

```

The variable `top_genes` will contain the gene names of the top 1000 most variable genes. The variable `cluster_labels` will contain the cluster labels assigned to each sample. The list `cluster_specific_genes` will contain the gene names that are specific to each cluster. The index `i` in `cluster_specific_genes[[i]]` indicates the cluster number (1 to `num_clusters`).
