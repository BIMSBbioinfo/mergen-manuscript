prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data in R, we can use the `read.xlsx()` function from the `openxlsx` package for reading the count table and the `read.delim()` function for reading the annotation data. 

Here's the code to read and display the number of rows and columns for each table:

```
# Load required libraries
library(openxlsx)

# Read count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Get the number of rows and columns for each table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
print(paste("Count Table - Rows:", count_rows, "Columns:", count_cols))
print(paste("Annotation Data - Rows:", annotation_rows, "Columns:", annotation_cols))
```

Make sure to replace the file paths in `read.xlsx()` and `read.delim()` with the actual file paths to the count table and annotation data files.

Output:
```Please note that you need to have the `openxlsx` package installed in order to use `read.xlsx()`. You can install it by running `` before running the above code.
