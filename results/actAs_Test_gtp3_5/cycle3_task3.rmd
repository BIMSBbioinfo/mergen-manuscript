prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To find the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the excel file and then calculate the dimensions of the data frame.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install and load the readxl package

library(readxl)

# Read the excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the dimensions of the data frame
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column (gene names)

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the actual file path of your excel file.

The code above reads the excel file using the `read_excel` function from the `readxl` package. Then, it calculates the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the total number of rows (excluding the header row). Similarly, it calculates the number of samples by subtracting 1 from the total number of columns (excluding the first column). Finally, it prints the number of genes and samples using the `cat` function.
