prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the gene expression data from the Excel file and then count the rows and columns.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load the readxl package
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the first column with gene names

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the actual file path to your Excel file.

The code uses the `nrow()` function to count the number of rows in the data, excluding the header row. Similarly, the `ncol()` function is used to count the number of columns, excluding the first column with gene names.

The results will be printed to the console, providing the number of genes and samples in the dataset.
