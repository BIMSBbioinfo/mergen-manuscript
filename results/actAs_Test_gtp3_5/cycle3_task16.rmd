prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will need to read the count table and the annotation data, merge them based on sample ids, and then create boxplots of gene expression values per sample using the merged data. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merge count table and annotation data based on sample ids
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = "sampleId")

# Function to plot boxplots and color code based on group variable
plot_boxplots <- function(data) {
  # Create a boxplot of gene expression values by sample and color code based on group variable
  ggplot(data, aes(x = sample_id, y = gene_expression, fill = group)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(x = "Sample", y = "Gene Expression") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "blue", "green")) +
    theme_bw()
}

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample
plot_boxplots(merged_data)
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths and names for your count table and annotation data respectively. Additionally, you can modify the color scale in `scale_fill_manual()` to suit your preference or to match the groups in your annotation data.
