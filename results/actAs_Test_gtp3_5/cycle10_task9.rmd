prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To complete this task, I will assume that you have already installed the necessary R packages such as `pheatmap`, `ComplexHeatmap`, and `ggplot2`. If not, please install them using the command `install.packages()`.

First, let's read the gene expression data from the "leukemiaExp.txt" file and store it in a data frame.

```
# Read the gene expression data
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)
```

Next, we need to filter the genes based on their variability. We can compute the variance of each gene using the `apply` function with `MARGIN = 1` to calculate the variance for each row (gene). Then, we can select the top 1000 most variable genes based on their variances.

```
# Calculate the variance of each gene
gene_variances <- apply(gene_data, 1, var)

# Select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_variable_genes <- names(sort(gene_variances, decreasing = TRUE))[1:1000]
filtered_gene_data <- gene_data[top_variable_genes, ]
```

Now, we can plot a heatmap with clustering for the variable genes using the `ComplexHeatmap` package.

```
library(ComplexHeatmap)

# Plot the heatmap with clustering
Heatmap(filtered_gene_data, name = "Expression", col = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c("blue", "white", "red")))
```

To plot PCA for the samples, we first need to transpose the filtered gene expression data so that samples are in rows and genes are in columns. Then, we can use the `prcomp` function to perform PCA and visualize the results using the `ggplot2` package.

```
library(ggplot2)

# Transpose the filtered gene expression data
transposed_data <- t(filtered_gene_data)

# Perform PCA
pca_results <- prcomp(transposed_data)

# Extract the PCA scores
pca_scores <- data.frame(Sample = rownames(pca_results$x), PC1 = pca_results$x[, 1], PC2 = pca_results$x[, 2])

# Plot PCA
ggplot(pca_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2") + theme_minimal()
```

Complete code:

```
# Read the gene expression data
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Calculate the variance of each gene
gene_variances <- apply(gene_data, 1, var)

# Select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_variable_genes <- names(sort(gene_variances, decreasing = TRUE))[1:1000]
filtered_gene_data <- gene_data[top_variable_genes, ]

# Plot the heatmap with clustering
library(ComplexHeatmap)
Heatmap(filtered_gene_data, name = "Expression", col = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c("blue", "white", "red")))

# Transpose the filtered gene expression data
transposed_data <- t(filtered_gene_data)

# Perform PCA
pca_results <- prcomp(transposed_data)

# Extract the PCA scores
pca_scores <- data.frame(Sample = rownames(pca_results$x), PC1 = pca_results$x[, 1], PC2 = pca_results$x[, 2])

# Plot PCA
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(pca_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2") + theme_minimal()
```
