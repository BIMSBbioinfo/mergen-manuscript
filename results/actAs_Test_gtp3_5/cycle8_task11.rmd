prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the datasets and count the number of rows and columns for each, you can use the following R code:

```
# Load the required libraries
library(data.table)

# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
methylation_data <- fread("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt")

# Count the number of rows and columns for the methylation dataset
num_rows_methylation <- nrow(methylation_data)
num_cols_methylation <- ncol(methylation_data)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects_data <- fread("subjects.txt")

# Count the number of rows and columns for the subjects dataset
num_rows_subjects <- nrow(subjects_data)
num_cols_subjects <- ncol(subjects_data)

# Display the results
cat("Number of rows in the methylation dataset:", num_rows_methylation, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in the methylation dataset:", num_cols_methylation, "\n")
cat("Number of rows in the subjects dataset:", num_rows_subjects, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in the subjects dataset:", num_cols_subjects, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file paths to your datasets.
