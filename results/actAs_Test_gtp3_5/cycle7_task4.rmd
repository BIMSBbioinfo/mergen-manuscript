prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples present in the count table, we can use the following R code:

```
# Read the count table from file
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2   # Subtract 2 to exclude the gene names and gene length columns

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Ensure that the count table file "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" is in the same directory as the R script or provide the full file path if it is located elsewhere.

The code reads the count table using the `read.table()` function, assuming the first row contains the column names. It then calculates the number of genes by getting the number of rows in the count table using the `nrow()` function. The number of samples is obtained by subtracting 2 from the total number of columns to exclude the gene names and gene length columns.

Finally, the code prints the results using the `cat()` function.
