prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each, we can use the `read.table()` function in R. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt file
met_table <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count number of rows and columns
n_rows_met <- nrow(met_table)
n_cols_met <- ncol(met_table)

# Read the subjects.txt file
subjects_table <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count number of rows and columns
n_rows_subjects <- nrow(subjects_table)
n_cols_subjects <- ncol(subjects_table)

# Print the results
print(paste("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt has", n_rows_met, "rows and", n_cols_met, "columns."))
print(paste("subjects.txt has", n_rows_subjects, "rows and", n_cols_subjects, "columns."))
```

Make sure to replace `"metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"` and `"subjects.txt"` with the actual file names and their respective paths if they are not in the current working directory.

This code will read both tables, count the number of rows and columns for each, and then print the results showing the number of rows and columns for each dataset.
