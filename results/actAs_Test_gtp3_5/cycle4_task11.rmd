prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each, you can use the `read.table()` function in R. 

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Count the number of rows and columns for "metRmOl" table
nrows_metRmOl <- nrow(metRmOl)
ncols_metRmOl <- ncol(metRmOl)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns for "subjects" table
nrows_subjects <- nrow(subjects)
ncols_subjects <- ncol(subjects)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
cat("Number of rows and columns in metRmOl table:", nrows_metRmOl, "rows,", ncols_metRmOl, "columns\n")
cat("Number of rows and columns in subjects table:", nrows_subjects, "rows,", ncols_subjects, "columns\n")
```

Make sure to replace the file names `"metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"` and `"subjects.txt"` with the actual file names in your working directory. The result will be printed, showing the number of rows and columns for each table.
