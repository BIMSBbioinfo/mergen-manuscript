prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To accomplish this task, you can use the `read_excel()` function from the `openpyxl` library to read the count table from the Excel file, and the `read.delim()` function from the base R package to read the annotation data.

Here's the code to read the count table and annotation data and obtain the number of rows and columns for each:

```
# Load required libraries
library(openpyxl)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of rows and columns for the count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Get the number of rows and columns for the annotation data
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows and columns for the count table:\n")
cat("Rows:", count_rows, "Columns:", count_cols, "\n")

cat("\nNumber of rows and columns for the annotation data:\n")
cat("Rows:", annotation_rows, "Columns:", annotation_cols, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace the file paths in the `read_excel()` and `read.delim()` functions with the actual paths to the files on your system.

This code will read the count table from the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" file, and the annotation data from the "SRP021193.colData.tsv" file. It will then calculate the number of rows and columns for each table and print the results.
