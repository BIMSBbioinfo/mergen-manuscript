prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete the task, we will need to install and load some packages, read the count table and annotation data, normalize the counts, and create two PCA plots color coded by "group" and "LibrarySelection" respectively. 

First, let's install and load the necessary packages:

```
# Install required packages if not already installed
if(!require("readxl")) 
if(!require("dplyr")) 
if(!require("ggplot2")) 
if(!require("tidyr")) 
if(!require("tibble")) 
if(!require("FactoMineR")) 

# Load the installed packages
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
library(FactoMineR)
```

Next, let's read the count table and annotation data:

```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Now, let's normalize the counts:

```
# Extract the count values from the count table
count_values <- as.matrix(count_table[, -1])

# Normalize the counts using the TMM method from the edgeR package
normalized_counts <- calcNormFactors(count_values)

# Add the gene names as row names to the normalized counts matrix
row.names(normalized_counts) <- count_table$Gene

# Convert the normalized counts matrix to a data frame
normalized_counts <- as.data.frame(normalized_counts)
```

Finally, let's create two PCA plots color coded by "group" and "LibrarySelection" respectively:

```
# Merge the annotation data with the normalized counts
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, normalized_counts, by.x = "sample.id", by.y = "row.names")

# Create the PCA plot color coded by "group"
pca_plot_group <- PCA(merged_data[, -c(1, 2)], graph = FALSE)
fviz_pca_ind(pca_plot_group, col = merged_data$group)

# Create the PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection"
pca_plot_library <- PCA(merged_data[, -c(1, 2)], graph = FALSE)
fviz_pca_ind(pca_plot_library, col = merged_data$LibrarySelection)
```

The PCA plots will be displayed in the R graphics device, each with the samples color coded by their respective annotation data ("group" and "LibrarySelection").
