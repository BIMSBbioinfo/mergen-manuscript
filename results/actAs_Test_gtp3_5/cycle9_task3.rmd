prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the excel file and then calculate the dimensions of the resulting matrix.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install and load the required package

library(readxl)

# Provide the file path to the excel file
file_path <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"

# Read the excel file
gene_expression_data <- read_excel(file_path)

# Count the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expression_data)
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expression_data) - 1  # Subtracting 1 for the gene names column

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```

This code will read the excel file "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", store the gene expression data in the `gene_expression_data` object, and then calculate the number of genes and samples. Finally, it will print the results.

Please note that you need to have the `readxl` package installed in order to run this code.
