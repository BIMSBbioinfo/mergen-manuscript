prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the gene expression dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then examine the dimensions of the resulting data frame.

Here's the code that accomplishes this task:

```
# Load the required library
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1

# Print the results
num_genes
num_samples
```

In the above code, we first load the `readxl` library. Then we use the `read_excel()` function to read the Excel file and save it in the variable `data`. Next, we calculate the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the total number of rows in the data frame (`nrow(data) - 1`), as the first row contains gene names. Similarly, we calculate the number of samples by subtracting 1 from the total number of columns in the data frame (`ncol(data) - 1`), as the first column contains gene names.

Finally, we print the numbers of genes and samples to the console.

Note: Make sure to install the `readxl` package before running the above code by using the command `` if you haven't installed it already.
