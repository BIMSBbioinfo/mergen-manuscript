prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we can use the following steps:

1. Load the required libraries: tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2
2. Read the count table and annotation data
3. Rename the columns of the count table to match the sample names in the annotation data
4. Merge the count table and annotation data based on matching sample names
5. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color-coded based on the "group" variable in the annotation data

Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Step 1: Load the required libraries
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Step 2: Read the count table and annotation data
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheetName = 1)
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Step 3: Rename the columns of the count table
colnames(count_table)[-1] <- annotation_data$sample_id

# Step 4: Merge the count table and annotation data
merged_data <- count_table %>%
  gather(sample_id, expression, -Gene) %>%
  left_join(annotation_data, by = "sample_id")

# Step 5: Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color-coded based on the "group" variable
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = sample_id, y = expression, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Sample", y = "Gene Expression") +
  ggtitle("Gene Expression per Sample")
```

Make sure to replace the file paths in the `read.xlsx` and `read.delim` functions with the actual paths to your files. Also, adapt the sheet name in the `read.xlsx` function if your count table is on a different sheet.
