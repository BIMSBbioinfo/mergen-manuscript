prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To solve this task, we need to load and merge the two datasets, filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or race, and then display the top 20 CpGs. 

Here's the code to accomplish these tasks:

```
# Load the required libraries
library(dplyr)

# Read the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Merge the datasets based on dbGap ID
merged_df <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "dbGap.ID", by.y = "dbGap.ID", all.x = TRUE)

# Filter CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or race
filtered_df <- merged_df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Age) & is.na(sex) & is.na(Race))

# Sort CpGs based on methylation values and select the top 20
top_20_cpgs <- head(arrange(filtered_df, desc(methylation_value)), 20)

# Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs
```

Please note that in the code, you might need to modify the file paths according to the actual locations of the datasets on your system.
