prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we can use the two datasets provided. Here's how we can accomplish this using R:

First, let's load the datasets into R:

```
# Load the methylation dataset
methylation <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Load the subjects dataset
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Next, we'll merge the two datasets based on the matching dbGap ID:

```
# Merge the two datasets
merged_data <- merge(methylation, subjects, by.x = "DBGapId", by.y = "dbGap ID")
```

Now, we can filter the merged dataset to find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race:

```
# Filter the merged dataset
filtered_data <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$Age) & is.na(merged_data$sex) & is.na(merged_data$Race), ]
```

Then, we can display the top 20 CpGs:

```
# Display top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_data$CpG_id, 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

This will give you the top 20 CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race.

Note: Please make sure the column names in the datasets match the code provided above. If the column names differ, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
