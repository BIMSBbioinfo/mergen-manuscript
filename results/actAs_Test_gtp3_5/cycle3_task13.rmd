prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables using R, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the required packages:
```
library(readxl)  # for reading Excel files
library(dplyr)   # for data manipulation
```

2. Read the count table and annotation data from their respective files:
```
count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

3. Merge the two tables by matching the sample IDs:
```
merged_data <- inner_join(annotation_data, count_data, by = c("Sample_ID" = "Gene"))
```

4. Calculate the number of columns in the merged data (excluding the "Sample_ID" column):
```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data) - 1
```

5. Print the result:
```
num_columns
```

Here's the complete code:
```
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

count_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

merged_data <- inner_join(annotation_data, count_data, by = c("Sample_ID" = "Gene"))

num_columns <- ncol(merged_data) - 1

num_columns
```

Make sure to update the file paths for the count table and annotation data in the `read_excel` and `read.delim` functions respectively.
