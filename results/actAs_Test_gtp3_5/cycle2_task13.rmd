prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and the gene expression table, you can use the `merge()` function in R. Assuming you have loaded the necessary libraries, here's the code to accomplish the task:

```
# Load the required libraries
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merge the count table and annotation data
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = 1)

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

Explanation:
1. Firstly, we load the required libraries `readxl` and `dplyr` using the `library()` function.
2. Then, we use the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package to read the count table from the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" file. We store the data in the `count_table` variable.
3. Next, we use the `read.delim()` function to read the annotation data from the "SRP021193.colData.tsv" file. This data contains the sample annotations and will be merged with the count table. We store the data in the `annotation_data` variable.
4. We use the `merge()` function to merge the count table and annotation data. The `by.x = 0` and `by.y = 1` arguments specify that we want to merge based on the first column of the count table (`0`) and the first column of the annotation data (`1`).
5. The merged data is stored in the `merged_data` variable.
6. Finally, we calculate the number of columns in the merged data using the `ncol()` function and store the result in the `num_columns` variable.
