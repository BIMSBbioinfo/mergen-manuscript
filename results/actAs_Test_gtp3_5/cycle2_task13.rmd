prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, you can use the `merge()` function in R. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1, header = TRUE)
gene_names <- count_table[, 1] # Extract the gene names
count_table <- count_table[, -1] # Remove the first column (gene names)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on matching sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = "sample_id")

# Calculate the number of columns (number of samples)
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data) - 1 # Subtract 1 to exclude the "sample_id" column

# Print the number of columns
print(num_columns)
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the correct file paths or URLs to your actual data files.

Note that in the code above, I assumed that the sample IDs in the annotation data and count table are stored in a column called "sample_id". If your actual data has a different column name for the sample IDs, you will need to adjust the `by.x` and `by.y` arguments accordingly in the `merge()` function.
