prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read and count the number of rows and columns for each dataset, we can use the read.table() function in R. Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file and count rows and columns
methylation_table <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
num_rows_methylation <- nrow(methylation_table)
num_cols_methylation <- ncol(methylation_table)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file and count rows and columns
subjects_table <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)
num_rows_subjects <- nrow(subjects_table)
num_cols_subjects <- ncol(subjects_table)
```

This code reads the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file into the "methylation_table" object and counts the number of rows and columns using the nrow() and ncol() functions. Similarly, it reads the "subjects.txt" file into the "subjects_table" object and counts the number of rows and columns.

To access the number of rows and columns for each dataset, you can simply print the variables num_rows_methylation, num_cols_methylation, num_rows_subjects, and num_cols_subjects.

```
# Print the number of rows and columns for each dataset
print(num_rows_methylation)
print(num_cols_methylation)
print(num_rows_subjects)
print(num_cols_subjects)
```

Note: Make sure to replace the file paths "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual paths to your files.
