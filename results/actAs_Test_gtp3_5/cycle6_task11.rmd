prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To complete this task, you can use the `read.table` function in R to read the datasets, and then use the `dim` function to count the number of rows and columns for each dataset.

Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" dataset
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
# Count the number of rows and columns
metRmOl_rows <- nrow(metRmOl)
metRmOl_cols <- ncol(metRmOl)

# Read the "subjects.txt" dataset
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)
# Count the number of rows and columns
subjects_rows <- nrow(subjects)
subjects_cols <- ncol(subjects)

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows and columns in metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt:", metRmOl_rows, "rows,", metRmOl_cols, "columns\n")
cat("Number of rows and columns in subjects.txt:", subjects_rows, "rows,", subjects_cols, "columns\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"` and `"subjects.txt"` with the actual file paths of your datasets. The code will read the datasets and output the number of rows and columns for each dataset.
