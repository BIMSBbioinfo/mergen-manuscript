prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables and count the number of rows and columns in each, you can use the `read.table()` function in R. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in metRmOl
num_rows_metRmOl <- nrow(metRmOl)
num_cols_metRmOl <- ncol(metRmOl)

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of rows in metRmOl:", num_rows_metRmOl))
print(paste("Number of columns in metRmOl:", num_cols_metRmOl))


# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in subjects
num_rows_subjects <- nrow(subjects)
num_cols_subjects <- ncol(subjects)

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of rows in subjects:", num_rows_subjects))
print(paste("Number of columns in subjects:", num_cols_subjects))
```

Make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file paths if they are located in a different directory.
