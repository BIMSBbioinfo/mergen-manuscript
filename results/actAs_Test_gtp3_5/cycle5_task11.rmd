prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables, count the number of rows and columns for each dataset, and perform the task using R, you can follow the code below:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count number of rows and columns for the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" dataset
num_rows_methylation <- nrow(methylation_data)
num_cols_methylation <- ncol(methylation_data)

# Count number of rows and columns for the "subjects.txt" dataset
num_rows_subjects <- nrow(subjects_data)
num_cols_subjects <- ncol(subjects_data)

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows in 'metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt':", num_rows_methylation, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in 'metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt':", num_cols_methylation, "\n")
cat("Number of rows in 'subjects.txt':", num_rows_subjects, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in 'subjects.txt':", num_cols_subjects, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace the file names `"metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"` and `"subjects.txt"` with the actual file names and paths if they are located in a different directory.
