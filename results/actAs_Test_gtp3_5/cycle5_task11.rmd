prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the tables, count the number of rows and columns for each dataset, you can use the read.table() function in R. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
met_table <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in met_table
met_rows <- nrow(met_table)
met_cols <- ncol(met_table)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subject_table <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in subject_table
subject_rows <- nrow(subject_table)
subject_cols <- ncol(subject_table)

# Print the results
cat("met_table Rows:", met_rows, "\n")
cat("met_table Columns:", met_cols, "\n")
cat("subject_table Rows:", subject_rows, "\n")
cat("subject_table Columns:", subject_cols, "\n")
```

This code will read the two files "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt", and store them in the variables `met_table` and `subject_table`, respectively. Then the number of rows and columns for each dataset will be counted and stored in the variables `met_rows`, `met_cols`, `subject_rows`, and `subject_cols`. Finally, the results will be printed to the console.
