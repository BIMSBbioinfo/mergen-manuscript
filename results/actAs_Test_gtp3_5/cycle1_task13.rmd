prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and the gene expression table, you can use the `merge()` function in R. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1, header = TRUE)
# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Merge annotation data and gene expression table based on common sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "SampleID", by.y = "Sample_ID")

# Calculate the number of columns (excluding the gene names column)
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data) - 1

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```

Make sure to update the file paths and column names (`SampleID` and `Sample_ID`) according to your data.
