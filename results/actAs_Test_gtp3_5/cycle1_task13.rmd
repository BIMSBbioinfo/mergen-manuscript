prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, you can use the `merge()` function in R. Assuming you have both the count table and annotation data in the same R environment, you can do the following:

``` R
# Read the count table from the excel file
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1, header = TRUE)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Merge the count table and annotation data by matching the sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "SampleID", by.y = "SampleID")

# Calculate the number of columns in the merged data
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

Note that you may need to install and load the required packages to read the excel file (`read.xlsx()`) and the annotation data file (`read.delim()`). You can install the `readxl` package for reading excel files and use the base R function `` to install it.

The variable `num_columns` will give you the number of columns in the merged data, which is the count table with the annotation data added.
