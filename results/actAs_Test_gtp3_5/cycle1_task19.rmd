prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete the given task, we will need to install and load some relevant packages, read the count table and annotation data, normalize the counts, and generate two PCA plots. Here's the code that accomplishes these tasks:

```
# Install and load required packages






library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(factoextra)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Normalize counts
normalized_counts <- count_table %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "genes") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -genes, names_to = "sample_ids") %>%
  left_join(annotation_data, by = c("sample_ids" = "sample_ids")) %>%
  group_by(genes) %>%
  mutate(normalized_count = value/sum(value)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Generate PCA plot - color coded by "group"
pca_plot_group <- prcomp(select(normalized_counts, -genes, -sample_ids, -LibrarySelection), scale = TRUE)
plot_group <- fviz_pca_ind(pca_plot_group, geom.ind = "point", col.ind = annotation_data$group)

# Generate PCA plot - color coded by "LibrarySelection"
pca_plot_library_selection <- prcomp(select(normalized_counts, -genes, -sample_ids, -group), scale = TRUE)
plot_library_selection <- fviz_pca_ind(pca_plot_library_selection, geom.ind = "point", col.ind = annotation_data$LibrarySelection)

# View the PCA plots
plot_group
plot_library_selection
```

Please note that you might need to modify the code based on the specific structure and format of your count table and annotation data files.
