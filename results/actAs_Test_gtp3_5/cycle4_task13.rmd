prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, you can use the following R code:

```
library(readxl)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Merge annotation data and count table
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "Sample_ID", by.y = "Sample", all.x = TRUE)

# Get the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
print(num_columns)
```

Make sure to replace the file paths in the `read_excel()` and `read.delim()` functions with the correct paths to your files. The `merge()` function is used to combine the two data frames based on a common column (`Sample_ID` in annotation data and `Sample` in count table) using a left-join (`all.x = TRUE`) to keep all rows from the annotation data.

The variable `num_columns` will contain the number of columns in the merged data, and it will be printed at the end.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance!
