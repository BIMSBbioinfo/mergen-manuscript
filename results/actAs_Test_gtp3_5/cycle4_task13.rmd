prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, you can use the `merge()` function in R. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.delim("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on sample ids
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "Sample_ID", by.y = "Sample_ID")

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```

This code assumes that the count table and annotation data are in tab-separated values (TSV) format. Make sure to provide the correct file paths in the `read.delim()` functions. The merged data will have the annotations appended as additional columns to the count table. The `num_columns` variable will store the number of columns in the merged data.
