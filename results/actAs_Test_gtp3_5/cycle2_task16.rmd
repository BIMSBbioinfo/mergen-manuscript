prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables and plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the count table and annotation data using the appropriate functions (e.g., `read.table()` or `read.xlsx()`).
2. Assign the first column of the count table as the row names for later merging.
3. Merge the count table and annotation data based on sample IDs.
4. Use the merged data to create boxplots, coloring them based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.

Here is the code to perform these tasks:

```
# Install and load required packages
    # if not already installed
     # if not already installed
library(openxlsx)
library(ggplot2)

# Step 1: Read count table and annotation data
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE)

# Step 2: Assign gene names as row names in the count table
rownames(count_table) <- count_table[, 1]
count_table <- count_table[, -1]  # Remove the first column (gene names)

# Step 3: Merge count table and annotation data based on sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by = "sampleids")

# Step 4: Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = .)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Group") +
  ylab("Gene Expression") +
  ggtitle("Boxplots of Gene Expression by Sample Group") +
  theme_bw()
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths of your count table and annotation data, respectively. Adjust any additional formatting options in the `ggplot()` function (e.g., change labels, titles, color schemes) to suit your preferences.
