prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To solve this task, we need to read the two datasets, merge them based on the common "dbGap ID" column, and then filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race. Finally, we will display the top 20 CpGs.

Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Merge the datasets based on the common column "dbGap ID"
merged_data <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGap ID", all.x = TRUE)

# Filter CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered_data <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$Age) & is.na(merged_data$sex) & is.na(merged_data$Race), ]

# Sort the CpGs based on their values
sorted_data <- filtered_data[order(filtered_data$CpG_id), ]

# Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_CpGs <- head(sorted_data$CpG_id, 20)
print(top_20_CpGs)
```

Make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the correct file names or file paths for your specific case.

Note: In this code, we assumed that the "dbGap ID" column in the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file has the same name and format as the "dbGap ID" column in the "subjects.txt" file. If the column names or formats are different, you need to modify the `by.x` and `by.y` arguments in the `merge()` function accordingly.
