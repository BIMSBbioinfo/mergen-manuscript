prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, we can use the `merge()` function in R. Here's the code to achieve that:

```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- readxl::read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merge the two tables based on the matching sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = "gene_name", all = TRUE)

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample
# Assuming the group variable is named "group" in the annotation data
boxplot_data <- merged_data[, -c(1, 2)] # Exclude sample_id and group columns
boxplot(boxplot_data, col = merged_data$group)
```

Note that you may need to install the `readxl` package if you haven't done so already. You can do this by running `` in R before executing the code.

Please make sure to replace the file paths and column names (if they differ from what I assumed) in the code with the actual ones from your data.

The resulting boxplot will display the gene expression values per sample, with the boxplots color-coded based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.
