prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To complete this task, we will utilize the R programming language and several bioinformatics packages. Here is the code to accomplish the given tasks:

```
# Load required packages
library(gplots)
library(ggplot2)
library(justRMA)
library(limma)

# Read the gene expression data file
data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# Calculate the gene-wise variability
gene_variability <- apply(data, 1, var)

# Sort the genes by variability in descending order
sorted_genes <- names(sort(gene_variability, decreasing = TRUE))

# Select the top 1000 genes with highest variability
top_var_genes <- sorted_genes[1:1000]

# Filter the data to retain only the top variable genes
filtered_data <- data[top_var_genes, ]

# Create a heatmap with clustering using the filtered data
heatmap(filtered_data, Colv = NA, scale = "row", main = "Heatmap of Top Variable Genes")

# Perform PCA on the original data
pca_data <- prcomp(t(data))

# Plot PCA for samples
pca_plot <- ggplot(as.data.frame(pca_data$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Principal Component 1") +
  ylab("Principal Component 2") +
  ggtitle("PCA Plot of Gene Expression Data")

# Display the PCA plot
print(pca_plot)
```

Make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file name and update the plot titles as desired. The code will read the gene expression data, calculate the gene-wise variability, select the top 1000 genes with the highest variability, filter the data based on these genes, and generate a heatmap with clustering. Additionally, a PCA plot for the samples will be created using the original data.
