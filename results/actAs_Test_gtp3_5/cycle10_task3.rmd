prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the gene expression dataset, we can use the `readxl` and `dplyr` packages in R to read the Excel file and perform data manipulation.

First, we need to install and load the necessary packages:
```



library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```
Next, we can read the Excel file into a data frame using the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package:
```
gene_expr_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```
To find the number of genes and samples, we can use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions:
```
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expr_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the gene name column
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expr_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the gene name row

num_genes
num_samples
```
The code subtracts 1 from the total number of rows to exclude the row containing gene names and from the total number of columns to exclude the column containing sample names.

Finally, we can print the number of genes and samples:
```
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Complete code:
```



library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

gene_expr_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

num_genes <- nrow(gene_expr_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the gene name column
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expr_data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the gene name row

cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
