prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `read_excel` function from the "readxl" package in R. Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install and load the required package

library(readxl)

# Specify the path to the excel file
file_path <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"

# Read the excel file
gene_expression_data <- read_excel(file_path)

# Get the number of rows and columns in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expression_data)
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expression_data)

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the actual file path and name of your excel file. The code reads the excel file using the `read_excel` function, and then calculates the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) using the `nrow` and `ncol` functions, respectively. Finally, the code outputs the number of genes and samples using the `cat` function.
