prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then calculate the dimensions of the data frame.

To start, we need to install and load the `readxl` package:

```

library(readxl)
```

Next, we can use the `read_excel()` function to read the Excel file and store it in a variable:

```
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
```

Now we can check the dimensions of the data frame using the `dim()` function:

```
num_genes <- dim(data)[1] - 1  # Exclude the first row (gene names)
num_samples <- dim(data)[2] - 1  # Exclude the first column (gene names)

# Printing the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples)
```

The code above reads the Excel file, subtracts 1 from the total number of rows and columns to exclude the gene names, and then prints the number of genes and samples in the dataset.
