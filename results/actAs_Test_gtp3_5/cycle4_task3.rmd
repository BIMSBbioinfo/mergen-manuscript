prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the pandas library in Python. We can read the data from the excel sheet into a pandas dataframe and then extract the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) from the dataframe.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the excel file into a pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns)
num_genes = df.shape[0]
num_samples = df.shape[1] - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the gene names column

# Print the number of genes and samples
print(f"Number of genes: {num_genes}")
print(f"Number of samples: {num_samples}")
```

This code will read the excel file and print the number of genes and samples present in the dataset.
