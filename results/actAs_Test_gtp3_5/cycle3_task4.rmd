prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, you can read the input file and count the rows and columns excluding the first and last columns, which represent gene names and gene lengths, respectively.

Here's the code to accomplish this task in R:

```
# Read the input count table
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Ensure that the input file "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" is in the same directory as your R script or provide the complete file path. The code assumes that the column headers are present in the file (header = TRUE) and the columns are separated by tabs (sep = "\t").

The code reads the count table into a data frame called "count_table". It then calculates the number of genes by counting the rows in the data frame using the `nrow()` function. The number of samples is determined by subtracting 2 from the total number of columns using the `ncol()` function.

Finally, the code prints the results using the `cat()` function.
