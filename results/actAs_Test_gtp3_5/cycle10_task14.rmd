prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the data and merge them into a single table using dbGapId information, return the number of columns.

response:
To complete this task, you can use the R programming language and several packages including `data.table`, `readr`, and `dplyr`. Here is the code to read and merge the datasets:

```
# Load required packages
library(data.table)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# Read the CpG methylation dataset
cpg_data <- fread("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt")

# Read the individuals dataset
subjects_data <- read_delim("subjects.txt", delim = "\t")

# Set the first row as column names in CpG methylation dataset
colnames(cpg_data) <- cpg_data[1, ]
cpg_data <- cpg_data[-1, ]

# Merge the datasets based on the dbGap ID
merged_data <- merge(cpg_data, subjects_data, by.x = "dbGapId", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Get the number of columns in the merged dataset
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```

Make sure to replace the file names with the actual file path if they are not in the working directory.

Note: The code assumes that the delimiter in the "subjects.txt" file is tab ("\t"). If it is a different delimiter, you can modify the `delim` argument in the `read_delim()` function accordingly.
