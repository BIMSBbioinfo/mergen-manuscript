prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the gene expression data file "leukemiaExp.txt" and count the number of rows and columns.

Here is the R code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the gene expression data from file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header=TRUE, sep="\t")

# Count the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns)
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes)
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples)
```

Make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file path and name if it's located in a different directory.

After running this code, you will see the number of genes and samples printed in the console.
