prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To solve this task, we will need to load the two datasets, merge them based on the common "dbGap ID" column, and then filter the CpGs that are associated with Age but not with sex or Race. Finally, we will display the top 20 CpGs.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load the required libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Set the working directory to the location of the datasets
setwd("path/to/datasets")

# Read the CpG methylation dataset
cpg_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Read the subjects dataset
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Merge the datasets based on the common "dbGap ID" column
merged_data <- merge(cpg_data, subjects, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
age_specific_cpgs <- merged_data %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Age) & is.na(sex) & is.na(Race)) %>%
  select(-Age, -sex, -Race)

# Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(age_specific_cpgs, 20)
```

In the above code, make sure to replace "path/to/datasets" with the actual path to the directory where the datasets are located.

The resulting variable `top_20_cpgs` will contain the top 20 CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race. You can inspect this variable to view the CpGs.

Please note that the code assumes that the datasets are in tab-delimited format. If they are in a different format, you may need to adjust the `read.table` function accordingly.
