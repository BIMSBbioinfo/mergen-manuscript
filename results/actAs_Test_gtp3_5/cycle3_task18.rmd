prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To complete this task, I will use the following steps:
1. Load the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file and the "subjects.txt" file into R.
2. Merge the two datasets based on the "dbGap ID" column.
3. Filter the merged dataset to select only the CpGs associated with age but not with sex or race.
4. Display the top 20 CpGs associated with age.

Here is the code to perform these steps:

```
# Step 1: Load the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Step 2: Merge the datasets based on dbGap ID
merged_data <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGap ID", all.x = TRUE)

# Step 3: Filter CpGs associated with age but not with sex or race
age_cpgs <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$Age) & is.na(merged_data$sex) & is.na(merged_data$Race), ]

# Step 4: Display top 20 CpGs associated with age
top_20_cpgs <- head(age_cpgs[, -c(1, ncol(age_cpgs))], 20)
print(top_20_cpgs)
```

Make sure to replace the file names in the `read.table` function with the correct file paths on your system. The code assumes that the first row of "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" contains the DBGap IDs.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance or clarification.
