prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To complete this task, we will need to load and process the two datasets: "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt". We will then filter the CpGs based on the conditions given and display the top 20 CpGs.

Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load the required packages
library(dplyr)

# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Rename the first column in subjects_data to match the first row in methylation_data
colnames(subjects_data)[1] <- colnames(methylation_data)[1]

# Filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered_data <- methylation_data %>%
  filter(colnames(.) %in% subjects_data$dbGap.ID) %>%
  select_if(function(column) !("Age" %in% subjects_data$Age & "sex" %in% subjects_data$sex & "Race" %in% subjects_data$Race))

# Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_data, 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

This code will read the two datasets into R, filter the CpGs based on the conditions given, and display the top 20 CpGs. The filtered CpGs will only include those associated with Age but not with sex or Race.
