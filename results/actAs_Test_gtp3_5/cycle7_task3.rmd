prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To find out the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the gene expression data from the Excel file and then count the number of rows and columns in the dataset.

Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install and load the 'readxl' package

library(readxl)

# Read the gene expression data from the Excel file
expression_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Count the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(expression_data)
num_samples <- ncol(expression_data)

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the correct file path/name of your Excel file.

The code first installs and loads the `readxl` package, then reads the gene expression data from the Excel file using the `read_excel()` function. It then counts the number of rows using `nrow()` and assigns it to `num_genes`, and counts the number of columns using `ncol()` and assigns it to `num_samples`. Finally, it prints the results of the counts.
