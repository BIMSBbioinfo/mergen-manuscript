prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then calculate the dimensions of the resulting data frame.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install and load the readxl package

library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Check the dimensions of the data frame
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the results
cat("The dataset contains", num_genes, "genes and", num_samples, "samples.")
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the actual file path of your Excel file.
