prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the count table file and count the number of columns and rows.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load required packages
library(data.table)

# Read the count table file
count_table <- fread("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv")

# Get number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2  # Subtracting 2 for gene name and length columns

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```
Note that we subtract 2 from the number of columns to exclude the first column containing gene names and the last column containing gene lengths. Adjust this calculation if your count table has a different setup.
