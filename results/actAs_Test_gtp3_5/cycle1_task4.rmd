prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the count table file, extract the necessary information, and count the number of unique gene names and sample columns.

Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Set the file path
count_table_file <- "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv"

# Read the count table using read.table() function
count_table <- read.table(count_table_file, sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Extract the gene names from the first column
gene_names <- count_table[, 1]

# Extract the sample columns
sample_columns <- count_table[, -c(1, ncol(count_table))]

# Count the number of unique gene names
num_genes <- length(unique(gene_names))

# Count the number of sample columns
num_samples <- ncol(sample_columns)

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes: ", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples: ", num_samples, "\n")
```

This code assumes that the count table file is located in the current working directory. Make sure to replace "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" with the actual file name or provide the full file path if it is located in a different directory.
