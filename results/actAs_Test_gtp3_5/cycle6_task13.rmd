prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, we can use the "merge" function in R. We need to match the sample IDs from the annotation data with the column names in the gene expression table.

Here's the R code to merge the tables and calculate the number of columns:

```
# Load required packages
library(openxlsx)
library(tidyverse)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Extract the sample IDs from the annotation data
sample_ids <- annotation_data$Sample_ID

# Select the columns from the count table that match the sample IDs
gene_expression <- count_table[, intersect(colnames(count_table),
                                           sample_ids)]

# Merge the annotation data and gene expression tables based on sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, gene_expression,
                     by.x = "Sample_ID", by.y = "colnames(count_table)")

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
print(num_columns)
```

Note: Make sure to install and load the "openxlsx" and "tidyverse" packages before running the code.

The variable "num_columns" will store the number of columns in the merged data frame, which corresponds to the number of samples in the RNA-seq experiment.
