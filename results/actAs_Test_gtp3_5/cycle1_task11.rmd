prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the R programming language and the `read.table()` function to read the contents of the datasets. We will also use the `dim()` function to count the number of rows and columns in each dataset.

First, let's read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" dataset and count the number of rows and columns:

```
# Read the dataset
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns
num_rows_met <- nrow(met_data)
num_cols_met <- ncol(met_data)

cat("Number of rows in met_data dataset:", num_rows_met, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in met_data dataset:", num_cols_met, "\n")
```

Next, let's read the "subjects.txt" dataset and count the number of rows and columns:

```
# Read the dataset
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns
num_rows_subject <- nrow(subject_data)
num_cols_subject <- ncol(subject_data)

cat("Number of rows in subject_data dataset:", num_rows_subject, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in subject_data dataset:", num_cols_subject, "\n")
```
Finally, let's put the code blocks together:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" dataset
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
# Count the number of rows and columns in met_data dataset
num_rows_met <- nrow(met_data)
num_cols_met <- ncol(met_data)

# Read the "subjects.txt" dataset
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)
# Count the number of rows and columns in subject_data dataset
num_rows_subject <- nrow(subject_data)
num_cols_subject <- ncol(subject_data)

# Output the results
cat("Number of rows in met_data dataset:", num_rows_met, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in met_data dataset:", num_cols_met, "\n")
cat("Number of rows in subject_data dataset:", num_rows_subject, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in subject_data dataset:", num_cols_subject, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace the file names "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file names and make sure the files are in the correct directory.
