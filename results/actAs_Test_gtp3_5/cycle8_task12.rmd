prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data, we can use the `read.xlsx()` and `read.table()` functions in R, respectively. Here's the code to read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each:

```
# Read count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_columns <- ncol(count_table)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_columns <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
print(paste("Count table has", count_rows, "rows and", count_columns, "columns"))
print(paste("Annotation data has", annotation_rows, "rows and", annotation_columns, "columns"))
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual file paths on your system.

This code will read the count table and annotation data, and then print the number of rows and columns for each table.
