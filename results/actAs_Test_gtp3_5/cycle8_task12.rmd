prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data in R, we can use the `read.xlsx()` function from the `openxlsx` package to read the Excel file, and the `read.table()` function to read the TSV file. 

Here's the code to read the count table and annotation data and count the number of rows and columns for each:

```
# Install and load required libraries

library(openxlsx)

# Read count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1, colNames = TRUE)
num_rows_count_table <- nrow(count_table)
num_cols_count_table <- ncol(count_table)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
num_rows_annotation <- nrow(annotation_data)
num_cols_annotation <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns for count table and annotation data
cat("Count Table:")
cat("\nNumber of rows:", num_rows_count_table)
cat("\nNumber of columns:", num_cols_count_table)

cat("\n\nAnnotation Data:")
cat("\nNumber of rows:", num_rows_annotation)
cat("\nNumber of columns:", num_cols_annotation)
```

Make sure to adjust the file paths accordingly to the location of your files.
