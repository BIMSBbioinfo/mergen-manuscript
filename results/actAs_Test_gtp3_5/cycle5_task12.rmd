prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read and analyze the count table and annotation data, you can use the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package to read the Excel file, and the `read.table()` function to read the TSV file. Here's how you can accomplish this task:

```
# Load the required packages
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of rows and columns for each data
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)
```

In the above code, `count_table` and `annotation_data` represent the count table and annotation data, respectively. `count_rows` and `count_cols` store the number of rows and columns in the count table, while `annotation_rows` and `annotation_cols` store the number of rows and columns in the annotation data.

You can access these values by printing the variables:

```
print(count_rows)
print(count_cols)

print(annotation_rows)
print(annotation_cols)
```

Make sure you have the necessary packages installed before running the code. If not, you can install the packages using the `install.packages()` function:

```

```

Remember to adjust the file paths according to the actual location of the files on your computer.
