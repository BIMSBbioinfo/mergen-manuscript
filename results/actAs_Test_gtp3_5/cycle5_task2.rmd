prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the "leukemiaExp.txt" file and count the number of rows and columns in the table.

Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns) in the dataset
num_genes <- nrow(data)
num_samples <- ncol(data)

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

By running this code, you will get the number of genes and samples in the dataset printed on the console.
