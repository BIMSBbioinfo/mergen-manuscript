prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, you can use the `merge()` function in R. Here's an example code that does that:

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Set the row names of annotation data as the sample ids
row.names(annotation_data) <- annotation_data$sample_id

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample ids
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "column_names", by.y = "sample_id", all.x = TRUE)

# Calculate the number of columns in the merged data
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

In this code, replace the file paths `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual paths to your count table and annotation data files, respectively. The merged data will have the count values for each gene and the corresponding annotation information.

At the end of this code, the variable `num_columns` will store the number of columns in the merged data, which represents the number of samples in the experiment.
