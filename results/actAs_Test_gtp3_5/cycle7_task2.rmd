prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read in the gene expression data from the "leukemiaExp.txt" file and check the dimensions of the data frame.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read in the gene expression data
expression_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(expression_data)
num_samples <- ncol(expression_data)

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

This code reads the "leukemiaExp.txt" file using the `read.table()` function and stores it in the `expression_data` data frame. We then use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions to get the number of genes and samples, respectively. Finally, we print the results using the `cat()` function.
