prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the given gene expression dataset, we can use the R programming language. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
gene_exp_data <- read.delim("leukemiaExp.txt", sep = "\t")

# Calculate the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(gene_exp_data)

# Calculate the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(gene_exp_data) - 1   # Exclude the first column containing gene names

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure you replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file name of your gene expression dataset in the above code.
