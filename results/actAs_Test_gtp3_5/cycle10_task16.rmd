prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, we can use the `read_excel()` and `read.table()` functions to read the Excel and TSV files, respectively. Then, we can use the `merge()` function to merge the two tables based on a common column, which in this case is the sample IDs.

Here's the code to merge the tables:

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Merge the tables based on sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = 0, by.y = 1)

# Remove the duplicate column
merged_data <- merged_data[, -1]
```

To plot the boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code the boxplots based on the "group" variable in the annotation data, we can use the `ggplot2` library.

Here's the code to plot the boxplots:

```
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Plot boxplots
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = gene_name, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  ggtitle("Boxplots of Gene Expression per Sample") +
  theme_bw()
```

Please make sure to replace the file paths with the correct paths to your files before running the code.
