prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset provided in the "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" file, we can use R programming language and bioinformatics techniques. Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the count table from the file
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2  # Subtracting 2 to exclude the first gene name column and the last gene length column

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

By running the above code, you should see the number of genes and samples printed in the console output.
