prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, we can use the merge function in R. First, we need to read in the count table and annotation data. Assuming the count table is in the format of a comma-separated values (CSV) file and the annotation data is in tab-separated values (TSV) format, we can use the following code:

```
# Read count table
count_table <- read.csv("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
```

Next, we can merge the two tables based on their matching sample ids using the merge function:

```
# Merge count table and annotation data
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = 0, all.x = TRUE)
```

The `by = 0` argument specifies that the merge should be performed based on the row names (sample ids). The `all.x = TRUE` argument ensures that all samples from the count table are included in the merged data, even if they don't have a match in the annotation data.

To plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, we can use the boxplot function in R. We can then color code the boxplots based on the "group" variable in the annotation data using the `col` argument:

```
# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample
boxplot(merged_data[, -ncol(merged_data)], col = annotation_data$group, xlab = "Sample", ylab = "Expression Value")
```

In the `boxplot` function, we use `merged_data[, -ncol(merged_data)]` to select all columns except the last column, which contains the group labels. The `col` argument is set to `annotation_data$group` to use the "group" variable for color coding. The `xlab` and `ylab` arguments specify labels for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.

Here is the complete code block:
```
# Read count table
count_table <- read.csv("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Merge count table and annotation data
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by = 0, all.x = TRUE)

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample
boxplot(merged_data[, -ncol(merged_data)], col = annotation_data$group, xlab = "Sample", ylab = "Expression Value")
```

Please make sure to replace the file names "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.csv" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file names and adjust the file formats if necessary.
