prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, you can use the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package to read the count table and the `read.delim()` function to read the annotation data. Here's an example code to merge the annotation data and count table, and plot boxplots based on the group variable:

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Merge annotation data and count table based on sample ids
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by = 0, all.x = TRUE)

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code based on group variable
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = as.factor(group), y = sample_value)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression Value") +
  theme_bw()
```

In the above code, make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" with the actual file path of your count table, and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file path of your annotation data.

The code uses the `merge()` function to merge the annotation data and count table based on the sample ids. Then, it uses `ggplot()` function to create boxplots, with the group variable determining the colors of the boxplots.
