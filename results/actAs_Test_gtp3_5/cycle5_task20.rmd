prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Find genes specific for each "group" in my annotation data  using statistical tests. Plot PCA only using "group" specific genes and color code PCA by "group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To accomplish this task, we will need to perform the following steps:
1. Read the count data table and the annotation data
2. Clean and preprocess the count data
3. Identify the group-specific genes using statistical tests
4. Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the group-specific genes
5. Plot the PCA with the color-coded group variable

Assuming you already have the required libraries installed (such as 'readxl', 'dplyr', 'DESeq2', and 'ggplot2'), here is the code to complete the task:

```
# Step 1: Read the count data table and the annotation data
count_data <- readxl::read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Step 2: Clean and preprocess the count data
# Assuming that the first column of the count_data is the gene names
# Setting row names as gene names for easy reference
rownames(count_data) <- count_data[, 1]
count_data <- count_data[, -1]  # Removing the first column (gene names)

# Step 3: Identify the group-specific genes using statistical tests
# Assuming the group variable is in the 'group' column of the annotation_data
group_specific_genes <- list()
groups <- unique(annotation_data$group)

for (group in groups) {
  group_samples <- annotation_data$sample_id[annotation_data$group == group]
  group_count_data <- count_data[, group_samples]
  
  # You can use different statistical tests depending on your data and research question
  # For example, we can use the DESeq2 package for differential expression analysis
  
  # Perform DESeq2 normalisation and differential expression analysis
  library(DESeq2)
  dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = group_count_data,
                                colData = annotation_data,
                                design = ~ group)
  dds <- DESeq(dds)
  
  # Get differentially expressed genes
  group_specific_genes[[group]] <- rownames(subset(results(dds), padj < 0.05 & abs(log2FoldChange) > 1))
}

# Step 4: Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the group-specific genes
# Combine the group-specific genes into a single vector
all_group_specific_genes <- unique(unlist(group_specific_genes))

# Subset count data and annotation data to include only the group-specific genes
group_specific_count_data <- count_data[all_group_specific_genes, ]
group_specific_annotation_data <- annotation_data[rownames(group_specific_count_data), ]

# Perform PCA using the group-specific genes
pca_data <- prcomp(t(group_specific_count_data))

# Step 5: Plot the PCA with the color-coded group variable
library(ggplot2)

pca_plot_data <- as.data.frame(pca_data$x[, 1:2])
pca_plot_data$group <- group_specific_annotation_data$group

ggplot(pca_plot_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA plot of group-specific genes", x = "PC1", y = "PC2")
```

Please make sure to adjust the file paths and column names according to your specific data files. The code assumes that the count table file is in the Excel format and the annotation file is in TSV format.
