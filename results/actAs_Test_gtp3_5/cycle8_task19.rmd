prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the following steps:

1. Read the count table and annotation data.
2. Normalize the counts.
3. Perform PCA with color coding by "group".
4. Perform PCA with color coding by "LibrarySelection".
5. Plot the two PCA plots.

Here is the code to accomplish these steps:

```
# Load required libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Step 1: Read the count table and annotation data
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header=TRUE, row.names=1)
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Step 2: Normalize the counts
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table,
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~ group)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized=TRUE)

# Step 3: Perform PCA with color coding by "group"
pca_group <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))
group_labels <- annotation_data$group
pca_plot_group <- ggplot(data = as.data.frame(pca_group$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group_labels)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Color coded by Group") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

# Step 4: Perform PCA with color coding by "LibrarySelection"
library_labels <- annotation_data$LibrarySelection
pca_plot_library <- ggplot(data = as.data.frame(pca_group$x), aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = library_labels)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Color coded by Library Selection") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

# Step 5: Plot the two PCA plots
print(pca_plot_group)
print(pca_plot_library)
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file names and paths. The code assumes that the count table is a simple tab-separated text file and the annotation data is another tab-separated text file. Additionally, adjust the column names (`group` and `LibrarySelection`) in the code according to the actual column names in your annotation data.
