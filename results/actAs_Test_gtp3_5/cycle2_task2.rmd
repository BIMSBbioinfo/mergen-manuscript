prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the gene expression data from the "leukemiaExp.txt" file and calculate the length of the rows and columns.

```
# Read the gene expression data
gene_exp <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(gene_exp)
num_samples <- ncol(gene_exp)

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

The output will display the number of genes and samples in the dataset.
