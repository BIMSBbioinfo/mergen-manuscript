prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the gene expression data from the file "leukemiaExp.txt" and count the number of rows and columns.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Get the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(data)

# Get the number of samples
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 for the gene name column

# Print the results
print(paste("Number of genes:", num_genes))
print(paste("Number of samples:", num_samples))
```

Running this code will provide the number of genes and samples in the dataset.
