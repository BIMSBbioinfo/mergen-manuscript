prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To accomplish this task, we will need to read both datasets and match the dbGap IDs in order to combine the relevant information. Then, we can filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display the top 20 CpGs.

Here is the code to achieve this:

```
# Read the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Match dbGap IDs and combine datasets
combined <- merge(x = metRmOl, y = subjects, by.x = "DBGapId", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Filter CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered <- combined[!((combined$Age == "") | !(combined$sex == "") | !(combined$Race == "")), ]

# Sort by CpG methylation values
sorted <- filtered[order(filtered$CpG_id), ]

# Display top 20 CpGs
top20 <- head(sorted, 20)
top20$CpG_id
```

Note: Please make sure to adjust the file paths in the `read.table()` function to match the actual locations of the datasets on your system. Also, modify the column names (`"Age"`, `"sex"`, `"Race"`, etc.) based on the actual column names in your datasets.
