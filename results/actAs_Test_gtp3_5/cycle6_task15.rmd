prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Read the data and merge them into a single table using dbGapId information. Plot a scatter plot of CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects in the samples.

response:
To complete this task, we first need to read the data from the two datasets and merge them using the dbGapId information. Then, we can select the two oldest subjects based on their age and plot a scatter plot of their CpG methylation values.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the datasets
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Extract the dbGapId column from the subjects dataset
dbGapIds <- subjects$dbGap.ID

# Set the dbGapId as the column names in the metRmOl dataset
colnames(metRmOl) <- metRmOl[1, ]
metRmOl <- metRmOl[-1, ]

# Merge the datasets based on dbGapId
mergedData <- merge(subjects, metRmOl, by.x = "dbGap.ID", by.y = "CpG_id")

# Convert the age column to numeric
mergedData$Age <- as.numeric(as.character(mergedData$Age))

# Select the two oldest subjects
oldestSubjects <- mergedData[order(mergedData$Age, decreasing = TRUE), ][1:2, ]

# Plot the scatter plot of CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects
plot(oldestSubjects[, 3:ncol(oldestSubjects)], type = "p", pch = 16, col = "blue")
```

This code reads the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file and the "subjects.txt" file into separate data frames. It then extracts the dbGapId column from the subjects data frame and sets it as the column names in the metRmOl data frame. The two data frames are then merged using the merge function based on the dbGapId column.

Next, the code converts the Age column of the merged data frame to numeric. It then selects the two oldest subjects by sorting the data frame by Age in descending order and selecting the top two rows.

Finally, the code plots a scatter plot of the CpG methylation values for the two oldest subjects using the plot function. The type argument is set to "p" to indicate a scatter plot, the pch argument is set to 16 to use a solid circle as the plot symbol, and the col argument is set to "blue" to use blue color for the points.
