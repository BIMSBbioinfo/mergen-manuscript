prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the "read.table" function in R to read the datasets and then use the "nrow" and "ncol" functions to count the number of rows and columns in each dataset.

Here is the code to read and count the rows and columns for each dataset:

```
# Read the dataset "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt"
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns
met_rows <- nrow(met_data)
met_cols <- ncol(met_data)

# Print the count
cat("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt dataset has", met_rows, "rows and", met_cols, "columns.\n")

# Read the dataset "subjects.txt"
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns
subject_rows <- nrow(subject_data)
subject_cols <- ncol(subject_data)

# Print the count
cat("subjects.txt dataset has", subject_rows, "rows and", subject_cols, "columns.\n")
```

Make sure to replace the file names with the actual names of the datasets you have in your environment.

The code above will read each dataset and store them in separate variables (`met_data` and `subject_data`). Then, it will count the number of rows and columns in each dataset using `nrow` and `ncol` functions. Finally, it will print out the counts for each dataset.
