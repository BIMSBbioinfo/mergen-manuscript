prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the read.table() function in R to read the datasets and then use the nrow() and ncol() functions to count the number of rows and columns in each dataset.

Here is the code to read and count the rows and columns for each dataset:

```
# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" dataset
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in "met_data"
met_rows <- nrow(met_data)
met_cols <- ncol(met_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns in "met_data"
cat("Number of rows in 'met_data':", met_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in 'met_data':", met_cols, "\n")

# Read the "subjects.txt" dataset
subject_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of rows and columns in "subject_data"
subject_rows <- nrow(subject_data)
subject_cols <- ncol(subject_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns in "subject_data"
cat("Number of rows in 'subject_data':", subject_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns in 'subject_data':", subject_cols, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file paths to the datasets on your computer.

This code reads the datasets, counts the number of rows and columns for each dataset, and then prints the results.
