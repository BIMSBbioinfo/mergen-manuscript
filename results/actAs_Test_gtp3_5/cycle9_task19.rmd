prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, you can use the Bioconductor package `DESeq2` to normalize the counts and the `ggplot2` package to create the PCA plots. Here is the code to accomplish the task:

```
# Load required packages
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Set rownames of count table as gene names
rownames(count_table) <- count_table$GeneName

# Remove the gene name column
count_table <- count_table[, -1]

# Transpose the count table to match with annotation data
count_table <- t(count_table)

# Create a DESeq2 object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table, colData = annotation_data, design = ~ 1)

# Perform normalization using DESeq2
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Get the normalized counts
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA
pca <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Create the PCA plot color coded by "group"
group_pca_plot <- ggplot(data = annotation_data, aes(x = pca$x[, 1], y = pca$x[, 2], color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Group", x = "PC1", y = "PC2")

# Create the PCA plot color coded by "LibrarySelection"
library_pca_plot <- ggplot(data = annotation_data, aes(x = pca$x[, 1], y = pca$x[, 2], color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Library Selection", x = "PC1", y = "PC2")

# Display the plots
print(group_pca_plot)
print(library_pca_plot)
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths to your count table and annotation data, respectively.

This code will read the count table and annotation data, normalize the counts using DESeq2, perform PCA on the normalized counts, and create two PCA plots color coded by "group" and "LibrarySelection" from the annotation data.
