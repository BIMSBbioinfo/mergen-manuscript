prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the R programming language and the following packages: `DESeq2`, `readxl`, `tidyverse`, and `ggplot2`. 

First, let's install and load the required packages:

```


library(DESeq2)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

Next, we will read in the count table and annotation data:

```
# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

Now, let's perform normalization using DESeq2. DESeq2 is a popular R package for differential gene expression analysis, but we can also use it for simple count normalization. We will convert the count table into a DESeqDataSet object, estimate the size factors, and normalize the counts:

```
# Convert count table to DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table[, -1],
                              colData = annotation,
                              design = ~1)

# Estimate size factors and perform normalization
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
```

Next, let's create a PCA plot with sample colors based on the "group" variable:

```
# Perform PCA
pca_group <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))
pca_group_df <- as.data.frame(pca_group$x)
pca_group_df$group <- annotation$group

# Create PCA plot with group color coding
ggplot(pca_group_df, aes(PC1, PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Samples Colored by Group")
```

Finally, let's create a PCA plot with sample colors based on the "LibrarySelection" variable:

```
# Create PCA plot with LibrarySelection color coding
ggplot(pca_group_df, aes(PC1, PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Samples Colored by LibrarySelection")
```

And that's it! The code above will normalize the counts, and create two PCA plots with sample colors based on different variables from the annotation data.

Complete Code:

```


library(DESeq2)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Convert count table to DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table[, -1],
                              colData = annotation,
                              design = ~1)

# Estimate size factors and perform normalization
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)

# Perform PCA
pca_group <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))
pca_group_df <- as.data.frame(pca_group$x)
pca_group_df$group <- annotation$group

# Create PCA plot with group color coding
ggplot(pca_group_df, aes(PC1, PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Samples Colored by Group")

# Create PCA plot with LibrarySelection color coding
ggplot(pca_group_df, aes(PC1, PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Samples Colored by LibrarySelection")
```

Note: Make sure to replace the file paths `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual paths to your files.
