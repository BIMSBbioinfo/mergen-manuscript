prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To complete this task, you can use the R programming language along with several packages such as `readr`, `dplyr`, `pheatmap`, and `FactoMineR`.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish the task:

1. Load the required packages:
```
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(pheatmap)
library(FactoMineR)
```

2. Read the gene expression data from the file "leukemiaExp.txt" and store it in a data frame:
```
gene_expression <- read_delim("leukemiaExp.txt", delim = "\t")
```

3. Rename the columns of the data frame to remove any leading or trailing spaces:
```
colnames(gene_expression) <- trimws(colnames(gene_expression))
```

4. Calculate the variability of each gene by calculating the standard deviation across samples:
```
gene_expression <- gene_expression %>%
  mutate(variability = apply(.[-1], 1, sd))
```

5. Sort the genes based on their variability in descending order and select the top 1000 most variable genes:
```
top_var_genes <- gene_expression %>%
  arrange(desc(variability)) %>%
  slice(1:1000)
```

6. Extract the gene names and expression values for the selected genes:
```
gene_names <- top_var_genes$Gene
expression_values <- data.matrix(top_var_genes[, -c(1, ncol(top_var_genes))])
```

7. Plot a heatmap of the expression values with clustering:
```
pheatmap(expression_values, cluster_rows = TRUE, cluster_cols = TRUE)
```

8. Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the samples:
```
pca_result <- PCA(expression_values)
```

9. Plot the PCA results:
```
plot.PCA(pca_result, choix="ind", habillage=top_var_genes$Gene, habillage.var = 2)
```

Complete code:
```
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(pheatmap)
library(FactoMineR)

# Step 2: Read the gene expression data
gene_expression <- read_delim("leukemiaExp.txt", delim = "\t")

# Step 3: Rename the columns
colnames(gene_expression) <- trimws(colnames(gene_expression))

# Step 4: Calculate gene variability
gene_expression <- gene_expression %>%
  mutate(variability = apply(.[-1], 1, sd))

# Step 5: Select top 1000 variable genes
top_var_genes <- gene_expression %>%
  arrange(desc(variability)) %>%
  slice(1:1000)

# Step 6: Extract gene names and expression values
gene_names <- top_var_genes$Gene
expression_values <- data.matrix(top_var_genes[, -c(1, ncol(top_var_genes))])

# Step 7: Plot heatmap with clustering
pheatmap(expression_values, cluster_rows = TRUE, cluster_cols = TRUE)

# Step 8: Perform PCA on expression values
pca_result <- PCA(expression_values)

# Step 9: Plot PCA results
plot.PCA(pca_result, choix="ind", habillage=top_var_genes$Gene, habillage.var = 2)
```

Make sure the "leukemiaExp.txt" file is in the same directory as the R script, or provide the correct file path as an argument to `read_delim` function.
The code will first load the necessary packages and then read the gene expression data from the specified file. It will then calculate the variability of each gene, select the top 1000 variable genes, and plot a heatmap with clustering. Lastly, it will perform PCA on the expression values and plot the PCA results.
