prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will need to load the count table and the annotation data, normalize the counts, and then create two PCA plots color-coded by different variables from the annotation data. We can achieve this using the R programming language and some commonly used bioinformatics packages.

Here's how we can approach this task:

1. Install and load the required packages:
```






library(readxl)
library(DESeq2)
library(tidyverse)
library(pheatmap)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(ggplot2)
```

2. Load the count table and annotation data:
```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

3. Normalize the counts using DESeq2:
```
# Create DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table[, -1],
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~ 1)

# Perform size factor estimation and normalization
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
```

4. Perform PCA analysis and create the first PCA plot color-coded by "group":
```
# Perform PCA analysis on normalized counts
pca_data <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Create PCA plot color-coded by "group"
group_colors <- brewer.pal(length(unique(annotation_data$group)), "Set1")
pca_plot_group <- ggplot(data = data.frame(pca_data$x, group = annotation_data$group),
                         aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = group_colors) +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color-coded by Group)")
```

5. Create the second PCA plot color-coded by "LibrarySelection":
```
# Create PCA plot color-coded by "LibrarySelection"
library_colors <- brewer.pal(length(unique(annotation_data$LibrarySelection)), "Set2")
pca_plot_library <- ggplot(data = data.frame(pca_data$x, library = annotation_data$LibrarySelection),
                           aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = library)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = library_colors) +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color-coded by LibrarySelection)")
```

6. Display both PCA plots:
```
pca_plot_group
pca_plot_library
```

That's it! You should now have the normalized counts and two PCA plots color-coded by different variables from the annotation data.

Note: Make sure to adjust the file names and sheet number in the code according to your actual files.
