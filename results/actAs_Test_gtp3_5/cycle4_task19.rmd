prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the following steps:

1. Read the count table and annotation data.
2. Normalize the count data.
3. Perform PCA analysis and create plots.

Let's start by reading the data:

```
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(openxlsx)
library(pcaMethods)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

Next, we will normalize the count data. There are several methods available for normalization, we will use the "TMM" method from the `edgeR` package:

```
# Extract the count values from the count table
count_data <- as.matrix(count_table[, -1])

# Perform normalization using TMM method
norm_count_data <- calcNormFactors(count_data)
```

Now, let's perform PCA analysis and create the plots:

```
# Transpose the normalized count data
norm_count_data_t <- t(norm_count_data)

# Add sample information to the normalized count data
norm_count_data_annotated <- cbind(norm_count_data_t, annotation_data)

# Perform PCA analysis using prcomp function
pca <- prcomp(norm_count_data_t)

# Create first PCA plot color-coded by "group" in annotation data
plot(pca$x[, 1:2], col = annotation_data$group, pch = 16)

# Create second PCA plot color-coded by "LibrarySelection" in annotation data
plot(pca$x[, 1:2], col = annotation_data$LibrarySelection, pch = 16)
```

This code will normalize the counts, perform PCA analysis, and create two PCA plots. The first plot will be color-coded by the "group" in the annotation data, and the second plot will be color-coded by "LibrarySelection" in the annotation data.

Note: Make sure to install the required libraries (`tidyverse`, `openxlsx`, `pcaMethods`, `edgeR`) before running the code.
