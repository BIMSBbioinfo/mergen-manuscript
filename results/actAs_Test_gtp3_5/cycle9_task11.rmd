prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To complete this task in R, we can use the `read.table()` function to read both datasets and then use the `dim()` function to count the number of rows and columns for each dataset. Here is the code:

```
# Read the first dataset
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
# Count number of rows and columns
metRmOl_rows <- dim(metRmOl)[1]
metRmOl_cols <- dim(metRmOl)[2]

# Read the second dataset
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)
# Count number of rows and columns
subjects_rows <- dim(subjects)[1]
subjects_cols <- dim(subjects)[2]

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows and columns in metRmOl dataset:", metRmOl_rows, "rows,", metRmOl_cols, "columns\n")
cat("Number of rows and columns in subjects dataset:", subjects_rows, "rows,", subjects_cols, "columns\n")
```

Make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file names for each dataset. The code will read the datasets, count the number of rows and columns for each, and then print the results.
