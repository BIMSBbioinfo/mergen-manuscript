prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here is the "Age" column. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. 
Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To accomplish this task, we will use the R programming language and its associated packages for data manipulation and analysis. By reading the datasets and performing basic operations, we can determine the number of rows and columns in each table.

Here's the code to complete the task:

```
# Load required libraries
library(data.table)

# Read the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file
met_data <- fread("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt")
# Count the number of rows and columns
met_rows <- nrow(met_data)
met_cols <- ncol(met_data)

# Read the "subjects.txt" file
subject_data <- fread("subjects.txt")
# Count the number of rows and columns
subject_rows <- nrow(subject_data)
subject_cols <- ncol(subject_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
print(paste("Number of rows and columns in the metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt file:"))
print(paste("Rows:", met_rows))
print(paste("Columns:", met_cols))

print(paste("Number of rows and columns in the subjects.txt file:"))
print(paste("Rows:", subject_rows))
print(paste("Columns:", subject_cols))
```

This code reads the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file using the `fread` function from the `data.table` package. It then counts the number of rows and columns in this dataset. Similarly, it reads the "subjects.txt" file and counts the rows and columns in that dataset as well.

Finally, the code prints the number of rows and columns for each table, providing the requested information.
