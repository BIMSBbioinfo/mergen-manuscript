prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data in R, we can use the following code:

```
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Get the number of rows and columns for each table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the number of rows and columns for each table
print(paste("Count table has", count_rows, "rows and", count_cols, "columns."))
print(paste("Annotation data has", annotation_rows, "rows and", annotation_cols, "columns."))
```

Make sure that the `Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx` and `SRP021193.colData.tsv` files are in the working directory or provide the full path to the files in the `read_excel()` and `read.delim()` functions respectively.

The code will read the count table and annotation data using the appropriate functions from the `readxl` library for Excel file and the `read.delim()` function for the tab-separated values file. Then, it will calculate the number of rows and columns for each table using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions, and finally, it will print the results.
