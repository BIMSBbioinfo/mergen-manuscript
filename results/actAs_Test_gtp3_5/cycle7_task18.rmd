prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To solve this task, we need to join the two datasets based on the "dbGap ID" column and then filter for CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race. Finally, we display the top 20 CpGs.

Here's the code to accomplish these tasks:

```
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)

# Read the datasets
methylation_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Join the datasets based on dbGap ID
joined_data <- inner_join(subjects_data, methylation_data, by = c("dbGap ID" = "X"))

# Filter for CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered_data <- joined_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(Age) & is.na(sex) & is.na(Race))

# Display top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_data$CpG_id, 20)
print(top_20_cpgs)
```

Make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the correct file paths or URL if necessary.
