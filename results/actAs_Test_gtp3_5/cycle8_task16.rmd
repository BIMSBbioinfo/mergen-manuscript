prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, we can use the `read.table()` function in R to read both files. Then, we can merge the data frames based on the sample IDs. 

After merging the data, we can use the `boxplot()` function to plot the boxplots for gene expression values per sample. To color code the boxplots based on the "group" variable in the annotation data, we can use the `col` argument in the `boxplot()` function.

Here is the code to accomplish these tasks:

```
# Read the count table and annotation data
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE)
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "sample_ids", by.y = "Sample")
  
# Extract the gene expression values for plotting
expression_values <- merged_data[, 2:ncol(merged_data)]

# Create a vector for colors based on the "group" variable
color_vector <- c("red", "blue", "green")[as.numeric(factor(merged_data$group))]

# Plot the boxplots with color-coded groups
boxplot(expression_values, col = color_vector)
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file names and make any necessary modifications to the code based on your specific data and column names.
