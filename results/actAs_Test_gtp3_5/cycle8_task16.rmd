prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables and plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample with color coding based on the "group" variable in the annotation data, you can use the following code:

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep = "\t")

# Extract the sample IDs from the annotation data
sample_ids <- annotation_data$sampleid

# Set the row names of the count table to be the gene names
rownames(count_table) <- count_table[,1]
count_table <- count_table[,-1] # Remove the first column

# Subset the count table based on the sample IDs
count_table <- count_table[, sample_ids]

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on the sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "row.names", by.y = "sampleid")

# Generate a dataframe for plotting with the required variables
plot_data <- data.frame(Group = merged_data$group, 
                       Sample = rep(colnames(count_table), each = nrow(count_table)), 
                       Expression = as.vector(as.matrix(count_table)))

# Plot boxplots of gene expression values per sample with color coding
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Sample, y = Expression, fill = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Sample") +
  ylab("Gene Expression") +
  theme_bw()
```

This code assumes that the count table and annotation data are in the same working directory. Make sure to adjust the file paths accordingly if they are in different directories. Also, note that you may need to install the required packages (`readxl` and `ggplot2`) if you haven't already done so.
