prompt:
I have a tab separated file called "subjects.txt". Read it and tell me how many rows and columns it has. 

response:
To read the "subjects.txt" file and determine the number of rows and columns, we can make use of the `read.table()` function in R. Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the file
data <- read.table("subjects.txt", sep = "\t")

# Determine the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- nrow(data)
num_columns <- ncol(data)

# Print the results
print(paste("The file has", num_rows, "rows and", num_columns, "columns."))
```

Make sure to replace "subjects.txt" with the actual file path if it is located in a different directory.

Once you run this code, it will read the file, determine the number of rows and columns, and print the result as a formatted string.
