prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To solve this task, we will need to load the data from the two datasets into R and perform data manipulation and analysis. Here's the code:

```
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)

# Read the methylation values dataset
methylation_df <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Read the subjects dataset
subjects_df <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Extract the required columns from subjects dataset
subjects_df <- subjects_df[, c("dbGap ID", "Age", "sex", "Race")]

# Transpose the methylation dataframe to have individuals as rows and CpGs as columns
methylation_df <- t(methylation_df)

# Assign column names from the first row (individual DBGapIds) 
colnames(methylation_df) <- methylation_df[1,]

# Remove the first row (DBGapIds) from the methylation dataset
methylation_df <- methylation_df[-1,]

# Convert the methylation values to numeric
methylation_df <- as.data.frame(sapply(methylation_df, as.numeric))

# Merge the methylation dataset with the subjects dataset based on dbGap ID
merged_df <- merge(methylation_df, subjects_df, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Filter CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
age_cpgs <- merged_df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Age) & is.na(sex) & is.na(Race)) %>%
  select(-Age, -sex, -Race)

# Display top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(age_cpgs, 20)
top_20_cpgs
```

Explanation of the code:
1. We load the required libraries, specifically the `dplyr` library for data manipulation.
2. We read the methylation values dataset from the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" file using `read.table()`. We set `header = TRUE` to indicate that the file has a header row.
3. We read the subjects dataset from the "subjects.txt" file using `read.table()`.
4. We extract the required columns (dbGap ID, Age, sex, Race) from the subjects dataset.
5. We transpose the methylation dataframe using the `t()` function to have individuals as rows and CpGs as columns.
6. We assign column names from the first row of the transposed methylation dataframe, which are the individual DBGapIds.
7. We remove the first row (DBGapIds) from the methylation dataframe.
8. We convert the methylation values to numeric using `as.numeric()` applied to each column.
9. We merge the methylation dataset with the subjects dataset based on the dbGap ID using `merge()`.
10. We filter the merged dataset to select CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race. We use `filter()` and `is.na()` to check for missing values in the sex and Race columns.
11. We remove the Age, sex, and Race columns from the filtered dataset using `select()`.
12. Finally, we display the top 20 CpGs using the `head()` function and assign it to the `top_20_cpgs` variable.
