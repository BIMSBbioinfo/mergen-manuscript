prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To solve this task, we need to load both datasets and perform some data filtering and manipulation. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load the required packages
library(data.table)

# Read the CpG methylation dataset
methylation_data <- fread("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Read the subjects dataset
subjects_data <- fread("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Set the first row as column names in methylation_data
colnames(methylation_data) <- methylation_data[1, ]

# Remove the first row from methylation_data
methylation_data <- methylation_data[-1, ]

# Filter the subjects_data to include only the required columns
subjects_data <- subjects_data[, c("dbGap ID", "Age", "sex", "Race")]

# Filter the methylation_data to include only the columns that match the dbGap IDs in subjects_data
selected_columns <- intersect(colnames(methylation_data), subjects_data[["dbGap ID"]])
methylation_data <- methylation_data[, selected_columns]

# Combine the methylation_data and subjects_data based on the dbGap ID
combined_data <- merge(methylation_data, subjects_data, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered_data <- combined_data[!is.na(Age) & is.na(sex) & is.na(Race)]

# Sort the filtered_data by CpG_id and select the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_data[order(CpG_id)], 20)

# Display the top 20 CpGs
print(top_20_cpgs)
```

Make sure to replace the file paths "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual paths to the files on your system.

This code reads both datasets using the `fread` function from the `data.table` package. Then, it sets the first row as column names in the methylation dataset and removes it. The subjects dataset is filtered to include only the required columns. The methylation dataset is also filtered to include only the columns that match the dbGap IDs in the subjects dataset.

The two datasets are then merged based on the dbGap ID. The merged dataset is filtered to include CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race. Finally, the filtered dataset is sorted by CpG ID and the top 20 CpGs are selected and displayed.
