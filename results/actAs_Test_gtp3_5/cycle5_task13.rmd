prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, you can use the `merge()` function in R. However, since the annotation data is in a different format (`tsv`), we first need to read it into R using the `read.delim()` function. 

Here's the code to accomplish the task:

```
# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheetName = 1, header = TRUE)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Merge annotation data and count table based on matching sample IDs
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = "Sample")

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the number of columns
cat("Number of columns:", num_columns, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the correct file path to your count table, and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the correct file path to your annotation data.
