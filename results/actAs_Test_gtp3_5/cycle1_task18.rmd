prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, we need to merge the two datasets based on the DBGap ID and then perform the analysis. Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the CpG methylation dataset
methylation <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE)

# Read the subjects dataset
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE)

# Merge the datasets based on DBGap ID
merged_data <- merge(methylation, subjects, by.x = "DBGapId", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Filter CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
age_cpgs <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$Age) & is.na(merged_data$sex) & is.na(merged_data$Race), "CpG_id"]

# Get the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(age_cpgs, 20)

# Display the top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs
```

This code will read the CpG methylation dataset and the subjects dataset into R. Then, it merges the datasets based on the DBGap ID column. The merged dataset will have information on individuals' DBGap ID, CpG methylation values, age, sex, and race.

Next, we filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race. This is done by checking if the Age column is not missing (not NA) and the sex and Race columns are missing (NA).

Finally, we extract the CpG IDs for these filtered CpGs and select the top 20 CpGs using the `head` function. The top 20 CpGs are stored in the `top_20_cpgs` variable and then displayed.
