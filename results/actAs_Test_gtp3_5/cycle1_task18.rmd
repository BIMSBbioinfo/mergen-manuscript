prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To solve this task, we will need to:

1. Read the two datasets: "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt".
2. Match the dbGap IDs from the second dataset with the first row of the methylation dataset.
3. Filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race.
4. Display the top 20 CpGs.

Here's the code to accomplish these steps:

```
# Step 1: Read the datasets
methylation <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
subjects <- read.csv("subjects.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Step 2: Match dbGap IDs
dbGapIDs <- subjects$`dbGap ID`
rownames(methylation) <- methylation$CpG_id
methylation <- methylation[, -1]
methylation <- methylation[, dbGapIDs]

# Step 3: Filter CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
age_cpgs <- rownames(methylation)[rowSums(subjects$Age != "") > 0]
sex_cpgs <- rownames(methylation)[rowSums(subjects$sex != "") > 0]
race_cpgs <- rownames(methylation)[rowSums(subjects$Race != "") > 0]
age_only_cpgs <- age_cpgs[!(age_cpgs %in% sex_cpgs | age_cpgs %in% race_cpgs)]

# Step 4: Display top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(age_only_cpgs, 20)
print(top_20_cpgs)
```

Make sure to replace the file names ("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt") with the actual file names in your system.

This code first reads the two datasets using `read.table()` and `read.csv()`. Then, it matches the dbGap IDs from the second dataset (subjects) with the columns of the methylation dataset. By indexing the methylation dataset using the dbGap IDs, we remove unnecessary columns and keep only the columns corresponding to the individuals.

Next, we filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race. We use the `rownames()` function to get the row names (CpG IDs) of the methylation dataset. We then use logical checks to find the CpGs associated with Age, sex, and Race, and remove those that are associated with sex or Race using the `%in%` operator. Finally, we use the `head()` function to display the top 20 CpGs.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
