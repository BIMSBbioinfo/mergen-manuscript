prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data in R, we will use the `readxl` package to read the count table from the Excel file and the `readr` package to read the annotation data from the TSV file. Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Read count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Count the number of rows and columns for each table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_columns <- ncol(count_table)

annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_columns <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the results
print(paste("Count table has", count_rows, "rows and", count_columns, "columns."))
print(paste("Annotation data has", annotation_rows, "rows and", annotation_columns, "columns."))
```

This code will read the count table from the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" file using the `read_excel()` function and store it in the `count_table` variable. It will also read the annotation data from the "SRP021193.colData.tsv" file using the `read_tsv()` function and store it in the `annotation_data` variable.

Then, the code will count the number of rows and columns for each table using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions. Finally, it will print the results using the `print()` function.
