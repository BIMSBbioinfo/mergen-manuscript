prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data in R, you can use the `read.xlsx()` and `read.delim()` functions respectively. Here's the code to accomplish that:

```
# Install required packages if not already installed
if (!require(openxlsx)) {
  
}
if (!require(tidyverse)) {
  
}

# Load required libraries
library(openxlsx)
library(tidyverse)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the count of rows and columns for each table
count_rows
count_cols
annotation_rows
annotation_cols
```

Make sure to replace the file paths ("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv") with the actual paths to the count table and annotation data files in your system.

This code will read the count table and annotation data, and then it will print the count of rows and columns for each table.
