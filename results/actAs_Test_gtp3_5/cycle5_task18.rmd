prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To complete this task, we will first load the datasets into R and then perform the necessary operations to find the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race. We will display the top 20 CpGs based on this association.

Here is the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load the required packages
library(dplyr)

# Read the methylation values dataset
met_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Read the individuals dataset
subjects_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Perform join operation on the datasets based on dbGap ID
joined_data <- inner_join(met_data, subjects_data, by = c("dbGap.ID" = "dbGap.ID"))

# Find CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
cpgs_age <- joined_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(Age)) %>%
  filter(is.na(sex) & is.na(Race)) %>%
  select(starts_with("CpG_id")) %>%
  melt(variable.name = "CpG_id", value.name = "methylation_value") %>%
  arrange(desc(methylation_value))

# Display top 20 CpGs associated with Age
top_20_cpgs_age <- head(cpgs_age, 20)
print(top_20_cpgs_age)
```

Make sure to replace "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file names and provide the correct file paths if they are not in the current working directory.

The code above reads both datasets, performs a join operation based on the dbGap ID column, filters the data based on the required conditions, and selects the CpG IDs associated with Age. Then, it arranges the CpGs in descending order of methylation values and selects the top 20 CpGs. Finally, it prints the top 20 CpGs associated with Age.
