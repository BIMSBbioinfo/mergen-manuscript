prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables, you can use the `merge()` function in R. Here's an example of how you can perform this task:

```
# Load the required libraries
library(readxl)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Set the row names of the count table as gene names
rownames(count_table) <- count_table[, 1]
count_table <- count_table[, -1] # Exclude the first column

# Merge annotation data with gene expression table
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by = "row.names")
rownames(merged_data) <- merged_data[, 1]
merged_data <- merged_data[, -1] # Exclude the first column

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Print the result
num_columns
```

Make sure to replace the file paths `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the correct paths to your files. The merged data will be stored in the `merged_data` variable, and the number of columns will be printed at the end.
