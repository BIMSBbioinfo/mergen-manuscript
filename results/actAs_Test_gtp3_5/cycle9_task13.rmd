prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression table, we can use the `read.table()` function in R to read both the count table and annotation table. Then, we can use the `merge()` function to merge the two tables based on the sample IDs.

Here is the code to merge the annotation data and gene expression table:

```
# Read count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Read annotation table
annotation_table <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# Merge annotation and count tables
merged_table <- merge(annotation_table, count_table, by.x = "sample_id", by.y = 0, all.x = TRUE)

# Calculate the number of columns
num_columns <- ncol(merged_table)

# Print the number of columns
num_columns
```

In this code, we assume that the first column of the annotation table is named "sample_id" and the row names of the count table are the gene names. Make sure to modify the code accordingly if your data has different column or row names.

The `merged_table` will be the merged table with the annotation data and gene expression values. The `num_columns` variable will contain the number of columns in the merged table, which represents the number of samples in the experiment.
