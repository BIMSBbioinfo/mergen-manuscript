prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To complete this task, we will use R programming language and several packages including `read.table`, `stats`, `pheatmap`, and `ggplot2`.

Here's the code to accomplish the task:

```
# Read the gene expression data
data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Compute the variance of each gene
gene_var <- apply(data, 1, var)

# Sort and select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_genes <- names(sort(gene_var, decreasing = TRUE))[1:1000]

# Filter the data to retain only the top 1000 genes
filtered_data <- data[top_genes, ]

# Plot the heatmap with clustering
library(pheatmap)
pheatmap(filtered_data, cluster_rows = TRUE, cluster_cols = TRUE)

# Compute PCA for samples
pca <- prcomp(t(filtered_data))

# Plot PCA
library(ggplot2)
percent_variance <- (pca$sdev^2 / sum(pca$sdev^2)) * 100
pca_data <- data.frame(Samples = colnames(filtered_data), 
                       PC1 = pca$x[, 1], PC2 = pca$x[, 2],
                       Variance = percent_variance)
ggplot(pca_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Variance)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", color = "Variance (%)")
```

Make sure to replace `"leukemiaExp.txt"` with the correct file path or name that contains the gene expression data.
