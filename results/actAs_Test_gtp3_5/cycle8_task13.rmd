prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables and calculate number of columns.

response:
To merge the annotation data and the gene expression table, you can use the `merge()` function in R. Since the file formats provided are Excel (.xlsx) and tab-separated values (.tsv), we'll need to load the required packages (`readxl` and `readr`) before proceeding.

Here are the steps to perform the task:

1. Load the required packages:
```
library(readxl)
library(readr)
```

2. Read the count table (Excel format) and the annotation data (TSV format):
```
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
```

3. Merge the two datasets based on matching rows (sample ids):
```
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "row.names", by.y = "sample_id")
```

4. Calculate the number of columns in the merged dataset:
```
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)
```

5. Finally, display the number of columns:
```
num_columns
```

Here's the complete code:

```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)
library(readr)

# Read count table and annotation data
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merge datasets based on sample ids
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "row.names", by.y = "sample_id")

# Calculate number of columns in merged dataset
num_columns <- ncol(merged_data)

# Display number of columns
num_columns
```

Make sure to replace the file paths `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` and `"SRP021193.colData.tsv"` with the actual paths to your files.
