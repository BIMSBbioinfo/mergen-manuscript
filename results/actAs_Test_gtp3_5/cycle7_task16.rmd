prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will use the `readxl` package to read the count table from the excel file, and the `read.delim` function from base R to read the annotation data from the tsv file. Then, we will merge the two data frames based on the sample ID. Finally, we will plot boxplots of gene expression values per sample using the `ggplot2` package, coloring the boxplots based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load required packages
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table from the excel file
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data from the tsv file
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Merge the count table and annotation data based on sample ID
merged_data <- merge(count_table, annotation_data, by.x = "sample", by.y = "Sample_ID", all = FALSE)

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color-coded by the "group" variable
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = gene_name, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  ggtitle("Boxplots of Gene Expression per Sample") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file names or paths to the files on your system.
