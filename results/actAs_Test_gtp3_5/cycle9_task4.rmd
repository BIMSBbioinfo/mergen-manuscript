prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the count table file and extract this information programmatically. Here's the code to achieve that using R:

```
# Read the count table file
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Count the number of genes
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Count the number of samples (subtracting 2 because of the gene names and length columns)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Please note that you need to replace `"SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv"` with the actual file path to your count table.
