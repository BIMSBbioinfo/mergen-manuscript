prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

To complete this task, you can use the following steps:

1. Load the necessary libraries: You will need the `readxl` library to read the count table from the Excel file, and `tidyverse` library for data manipulation and visualization.

2. Read the count table: Use the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` library to read the count table from the "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" file. Assign this count table to a variable, let's say `counts`.

3. Read the annotation data: Use the `read_delim()` function from the `tidyverse` library to read the annotation data from the "SRP021193.colData.tsv" file. Assign this annotation data to a variable, let's say `annotations`.

4. Normalize counts: You can use any suitable method to normalize the count data. For example, you can use the `voom()` function from the `limma` library for normalization. Here's an example of how to normalize the counts using the voom method:

```
library(limma)
normalized_counts <- voom(counts)
```

5. Merge the count table with the annotation data: To perform PCA analysis with the sample labels, you need to merge the count table with the annotation data. You can use the `left_join()` function from the `dplyr` library to merge the two datasets based on the sample IDs. Assuming the sample IDs are stored in a column named "SampleID" in both datasets, you can use the following code:

```
library(dplyr)
merged_data <- left_join(normalized_counts, annotations, by = c("SampleID" = "SampleID"))
```

6. Perform PCA analysis: Use the `prcomp()` function to perform PCA analysis on the merged dataset. Specify the columns to be used for the PCA analysis. For example, if the columns containing the normalized counts are named "Sample1", "Sample2", etc., and you want to perform PCA based on these columns, you can use the following code:

```
pca <- prcomp(merged_data[, c("Sample1", "Sample2", ...)])
```

7. Create PCA plots: Use the `ggplot2` library to create the PCA plots. For color coding the samples based on the "group" column in the annotation data, you can use the following code:

```
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(merged_data, aes(PC1, PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color coded by Group)")
```

Similarly, to color code the samples based on the "LibrarySelection" column, you can modify the code as follows:

```
ggplot(merged_data, aes(PC1, PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color coded by Library Selection)")
```

Here's the complete code block for all the steps:

```
# Step 1: Load libraries
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Step 2: Read count table
counts <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Step 3: Read annotation data
annotations <- read_delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv", delim = "\t")

# Step 4: Normalize counts
library(limma)
normalized_counts <- voom(counts)

# Step 5: Merge count table with annotation data
library(dplyr)
merged_data <- left_join(normalized_counts, annotations, by = c("SampleID" = "SampleID"))

# Step 6: Perform PCA analysis
pca <- prcomp(merged_data[, c("Sample1", "Sample2", ...)])

# Step 7: Create PCA plots
library(ggplot2)
# Color coded by "group" column
ggplot(merged_data, aes(PC1, PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color coded by Group)")

# Color coded by "LibrarySelection" column
ggplot(merged_data, aes(PC1, PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot (Color coded by Library Selection)")
```
Remember to modify the column names and file paths based on your actual data.
Note: This code assumes that the Excel file and tsv file are in the same directory as your R script. If they are located in a different directory, you will need to provide the full file path in the `read_excel()` and `read_delim()` functions.
