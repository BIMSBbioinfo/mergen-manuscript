prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the given dataset, we can read the "leukemiaExp.txt" file and count the number of rows and columns.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Read the gene expression data from the file
gene_expression <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of rows (genes)
num_genes <- nrow(gene_expression)

# Count the number of columns (samples)
num_samples <- ncol(gene_expression)

# Print the number of genes and samples
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the correct file path if necessary.

After running the above code, you will see the number of genes and samples printed in the console output.
