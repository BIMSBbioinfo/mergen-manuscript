prompt:
I have the following gene expression data, "leukemiaExp.txt". The file is tab separated. The table has gene names on the first column. Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. Filter genes based on their variability so we retain the most variable top 1000 genes. Based on these variable genes, plot a heatmap with clustering. Also plot PCA for samples.

response:
To complete this task, we will use R and the following packages: 'readr' for reading the gene expression data, 'Biobase' for filtering genes based on variability, 'pheatmap' for plotting the heatmap, and 'ggplot2' for plotting PCA.

Here's the code to perform the desired tasks:

```
# Load required packages
library(readr)
library(Biobase)
library(pheatmap)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the gene expression data
gene_data <- read.table("leukemiaExp.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Filter genes based on variability
gene_variability <- rowVars(gene_data[, -1])
top_variable_genes <- rownames(gene_data)[order(gene_variability, decreasing = TRUE)][1:1000]
filtered_gene_data <- gene_data[top_variable_genes, ]

# Plot heatmap with clustering
pheatmap(filtered_gene_data[, -1], clustering_distance_rows = "euclidean", clustering_distance_cols = "euclidean")

# Perform PCA for samples
pca <- prcomp(t(filtered_gene_data[, -1]))

# Plot PCA
pca_data <- data.frame(Sample = colnames(filtered_gene_data[, -1]), PC1 = pca$x[, 1], PC2 = pca$x[, 2])

ggplot(pca_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Principal Component 1", y = "Principal Component 2")
```

Make sure to replace "leukemiaExp.txt" with the actual file name and update any parameters for clustering and visualization as per your requirements.
