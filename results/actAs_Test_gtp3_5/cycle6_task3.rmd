prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the gene expression dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the data from the Excel file and then extract the necessary information.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install and load the readxl package

library(readxl)

# Specify the path to the Excel file
file_path <- "path/to/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel(file_path)

# Extract the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Exclude the header row containing gene names
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Exclude the first column containing gene names

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"path/to/Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the actual file path to the Excel file on your system.

The code reads the Excel file using `read_excel()` and stores the data in the `data` object. Then, it calculates the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the total number of rows in the dataset (excluding the header row containing gene names), and the number of samples by subtracting 1 from the total number of columns (excluding the first column containing gene names). Finally, the code prints the number of genes and samples using `cat()`.

Please note that the code assumes that the first row of the Excel file contains the header information and the gene names are listed in the first column. If your Excel file structure differs, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
