prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the "readxl" package in R to read the Excel file and extract the necessary information. Here's the code:

```
# Load the required package
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
gene_exp_data <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes and samples
num_genes <- nrow(gene_exp_data) - 1 # Subtracting 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(gene_exp_data) - 1 # Subtracting 1 to exclude the gene name column

# Print the results
num_genes  # prints the number of genes
num_samples  # prints the number of samples
```

Make sure to install the "readxl" package if it's not already installed in your R environment. You can install it by running ``.

The code reads the Excel file using the `read_excel()` function and stores the data in the `gene_exp_data` variable. Then, it calculates the number of genes by subtracting 1 from the total number of rows, excluding the header row. Similarly, it calculates the number of samples by subtracting 1 from the total number of columns, excluding the gene name column. Finally, the code prints the results.
