prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv". The first column contains the gene names, the last column is gene length and the rest are samples.The file is tab separated. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can read the count table file and count the number of columns (excluding the first and last column) for samples and the number of rows for genes.

Here's how you can do it in R:

```
# Read the count table file
count_table <- read.table("SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Count the number of genes (number of rows)
num_genes <- nrow(count_table)

# Count the number of samples (number of columns excluding the first and last column)
num_samples <- ncol(count_table) - 2

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace "SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv" with the correct file path and name.

The result will be printed on the console, showing the number of genes and samples in the dataset.
