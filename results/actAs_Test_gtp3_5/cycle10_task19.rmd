prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, I would first load the count table and annotation data into R. Then, I would normalize the counts using a suitable method. Finally, I would create two PCA plots, one color-coded by the "group" variable and the other color-coded by the "LibrarySelection" variable.

Here's the code to accomplish these tasks:

```
# Load required packages
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)

# Read count table
count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", header=TRUE, row.names=1, sep="\t")

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", header=TRUE, row.names=1, sep="\t")

# Normalize counts using DESeq2
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table,
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~ 1)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized=TRUE)

# Perform PCA
pca <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Create PCA plot color-coded by "group"
group_colors <- c("Control"="blue", "Treatment"="red")
group_color_labels <- as.numeric(factor(annotation_data$group))
group_color_labels <- plyr::mapvalues(group_color_labels, from=1:length(group_colors), to=group_colors)
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=group_color_labels, pch=16, xlab="PC1", ylab="PC2", main="PCA Plot (Color-coded by Group)")

# Create PCA plot color-coded by "LibrarySelection"
library_colors <- c("PolyA"="green", "RiboMinus"="orange", "RiboZero"="purple")
library_color_labels <- plyr::mapvalues(annotation_data$LibrarySelection, from=library_colors)
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=library_color_labels, pch=16, xlab="PC1", ylab="PC2", main="PCA Plot (Color-coded by Library Selection)")
```

Please note that the code assumes that the count table is in tab-separated format with row names for genes and column names for samples, and the annotation data is also in tab-separated format with row names for sample ids. The code also assumes that the required packages (DESeq2, ggplot2, and plyr) are already installed and loaded. You may need to adjust the code according to your specific data format and package setup.
