prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Normalize counts, make two PCA plots for samples, one color coded samples by "group" and the other color coded by "LibrarySelection" in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, we will make use of the `DESeq2`, `ggplot2`, and `reshape2` packages in R. We will perform the following steps:

1. Read in the count table and annotation data.
2. Normalize the count data using DESeq2.
3. Perform PCA on the normalized count data.
4. Create two PCA plots, one color-coded by "group" and the other color-coded by "LibrarySelection" in the annotation data.

Here's the code to accomplish these steps:

```
# Step 1: Read in the count table and annotation data
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

count_table <- read.table("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sep="\t", header=TRUE, row.names=1)
annotation_data <- read.table("SRP021193.colData.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Step 2: Normalize the count data
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_table,
                              colData = annotation_data,
                              design = ~ 1)

dds <- DESeq(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized=TRUE)

# Step 3: Perform PCA on the normalized count data
pca <- prcomp(t(normalized_counts))

# Step 4: Create PCA plots
# Color-coded by "group"
group_pca <- data.frame(Sample = colnames(normalized_counts),
                        PC1 = pca$x[,1],
                        PC2 = pca$x[,2],
                        Group = annotation_data$group)

# Color-coded by "LibrarySelection"
library_pca <- data.frame(Sample = colnames(normalized_counts),
                           PC1 = pca$x[,1],
                           PC2 = pca$x[,2],
                           LibrarySelection = annotation_data$LibrarySelection)

# Plot color-coded by "group"
ggplot(group_pca, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Color-coded by Group")

# Plot color-coded by "LibrarySelection"
ggplot(library_pca, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = LibrarySelection)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot - Color-coded by LibrarySelection")
```

Please make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths to your count table and annotation data, respectively.
