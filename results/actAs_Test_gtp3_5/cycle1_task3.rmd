prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `readxl` package in R to read the Excel file and then check the dimensions of the resulting data frame.

Here is the code to accomplish this:

```
# Load the required package
library(readxl)

# Set the file path
file_path <- "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel(file_path)

# Get the dimensions of the data frame
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the gene names column

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the actual file path of your dataset.

By running this code, you will get the number of genes and samples in the dataset printed in the console.
