prompt:
I have the following gene expression data as an excel sheet,  "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". Each row is a gene and each column is a distinct sample. First column contains gene names. How many genes and samples does the dataset have?

response:
To determine the number of genes and samples in the dataset, we can use the `read.xlsx()` function from the `openxlsx` package to read the Excel file, and then calculate the dimensions of the resulting data frame.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Install and load the required package

library(openxlsx)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Get the number of genes (rows) and samples (columns)
num_genes <- nrow(data) - 1    # Subtracting 1 to exclude the header row
num_samples <- ncol(data) - 1  # Subtracting 1 to exclude the gene name column

# Print the results
cat("Number of genes:", num_genes, "\n")
cat("Number of samples:", num_samples, "\n")
```

Make sure to replace `"Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx"` with the actual path to your Excel file.

After running the code, you will see the number of genes and samples printed in the console.
