prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To solve this task, we need to read the two datasets, merge them based on the matching DBGap ID, filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and then display the top 20 CpGs. Here's a step-by-step solution in R:

1. Read the datasets:

```
# Read CpG methylation dataset
cpg_data <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Read individual information dataset
individual_data <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

2. Merge the datasets based on the DBGap ID:

```
# Match the DBGap ID columns and merge the datasets
merged_data <- merge(cpg_data, individual_data, by.x = "DBGapId", by.y = "dbGap ID", all.x = TRUE)
```

3. Filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race:

```
# Filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered_data <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$Age) & is.na(merged_data$sex) & is.na(merged_data$Race), ]
```

4. Display the top 20 CpGs:

```
# Display the top 20 CpGs
top_cpgs <- head(filtered_data$CpG_id, 20)
top_cpgs
```

This solution assumes that the CpG methylation dataset has a header row and the individual information dataset has a header row as well. The code reads the datasets, merges them based on the DBGap ID, filters the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and finally displays the top 20 CpGs.
