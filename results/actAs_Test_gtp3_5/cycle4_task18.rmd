prompt:
We have the following datasets. One of the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table this is contained in the “metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt” file. Each column is an individual represented by a DBGapId, which is included as the first row. Each row is a CpG represented by "CpG_id", values in the table are methylation values. Another data set is contained in “subjects.txt”. This file has the information on the individuals. Most important feature for us here are the "Age","sex" and "Race" columns. The "dbGap ID" column (second column) in this table should match the first row of the "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", and they represent the same individuals. Find all CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display top 20 CpGs.

response:
To complete this task, we need to load both datasets, merge them based on the "dbGap ID" column, filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race, and display the top 20 CpGs.

Here's the code to accomplish this task:

```
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Load and read the CpG methylation dataset
metRmOl <- read.table("metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Load and read the individuals dataset
subjects <- read.table("subjects.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Merge the datasets based on "dbGap ID" column
merged_data <- merge(metRmOl, subjects, by.x = "dbGap ID", by.y = "dbGap ID")

# Filter the CpGs associated with Age but not with sex or Race
filtered_cpgs <- merged_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(Age) & is.na(sex) & is.na(Race))

# Display top 20 CpGs
top_20_cpgs <- head(filtered_cpgs$CpG_id, 20)
print(top_20_cpgs)
```

Make sure to replace the file names "metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt" and "subjects.txt" with the actual file names and adjust the column names in the code if necessary.

Note that this code assumes that the CpG methylation dataset (metRmOlWithDbgapIdHeader.txt) has a header row with CpG IDs and the individuals dataset (subjects.txt) has columns named "dbGap ID", "Age", "sex", and "Race".
