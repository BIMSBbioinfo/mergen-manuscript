prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data in R, we can use the `read.xlsx()` function from the `openxlsx` package for the count table and the `read.delim()` function for the annotation data. Here's the code to read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each:

```
# Load required packages
library(openxlsx)

# Read count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)
# Count number of rows and columns in count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Read annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")
# Count number of rows and columns in annotation data
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)
```

Make sure to replace the file paths with the correct paths to the count table and annotation data files on your system. After running this code, the variables `count_rows`, `count_cols`, `annotation_rows`, and `annotation_cols` will contain the number of rows and columns in the count table and annotation data, respectively.
