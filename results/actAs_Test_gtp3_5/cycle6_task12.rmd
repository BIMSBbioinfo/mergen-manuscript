prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Read the tables count number of rows and columns for each.

response:
To read the count table and annotation data, we can use the `read.xlsx()` and `read.delim()` functions from the `openxlsx` and `readr` packages respectively. Here's the code to read the tables and count the number of rows and columns for each:

```
# Install necessary packages



# Load required libraries
library(openxlsx)
library(readr)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read.xlsx("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx", sheet = 1)

# Count number of rows and columns in count table
count_rows <- nrow(count_table)
count_cols <- ncol(count_table)

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Count number of rows and columns in annotation data
annotation_rows <- nrow(annotation_data)
annotation_cols <- ncol(annotation_data)

# Print the results
cat("Count Table Rows:", count_rows, "\n")
cat("Count Table Columns:", count_cols, "\n")
cat("Annotation Data Rows:", annotation_rows, "\n")
cat("Annotation Data Columns:", annotation_cols, "\n")
```

Note: Please make sure that the input file paths are correct and that the required packages (`openxlsx` and `readr`) are installed before running the code.
