prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To merge the annotation data and gene expression tables and plot boxplots based on the "group" variable, we can use the following code:

```
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read the annotation data
annotation_data <- read.delim("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merge annotation data and gene expression tables by sample ids
merged_data <- merge(annotation_data, count_table, by.x = "sample_ids", by.y = "Sample")

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, colored by the "group" variable
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = Gene1)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  ggtitle("Gene Expression Boxplots by Group")
```

Make sure to replace "Gene1" with the actual column name of the gene you want to plot boxplots for. Repeat the `geom_boxplot()` line for each gene you want to plot.

Note: This code assumes that the columns with gene names and sample ids have the same name in both files ("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv"). If they have different names, please adjust the `by.x` and `by.y` parameters accordingly in the `merge()` function.
