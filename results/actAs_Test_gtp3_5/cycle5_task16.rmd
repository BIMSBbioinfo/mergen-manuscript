prompt:
I have the following count table for an RNA-seq experiment, rows are genes and columns are samples, "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx". The first column of the file is my gene names and the rest of the columns are samples. My annotation data is here  "SRP021193.colData.tsv", it contains sample annotations and rows of this matches the columns of count table, first column is the sample ids. Merge annotation data and gene expression tables. Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample and color code boxplots based on group" variable in my annotation data.

response:
To complete this task, you will need to install and load the necessary libraries, read in the count table and annotation data, merge them together, and then plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color-coded based on the "group" variable in the annotation data.

Here's the code to achieve this:

```
# Install and load required libraries
  # For reading Excel files
  # For data manipulation and visualization
  # For creating plots

library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# Read in the count table
count_table <- read_excel("Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx")

# Read in the annotation data
annotation_data <- read_tsv("SRP021193.colData.tsv")

# Merge annotation data and count table
merged_data <- left_join(annotation_data, count_table, by = "sample_id")

# Plot boxplots for gene expression values per sample, color-coded based on the group variable
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = group, y = gene_name, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Gene Expression") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Make sure to replace "Supplementary_Table_1_exp.xlsx" and "SRP021193.colData.tsv" with the actual file paths and names of your count table and annotation data files, respectively.
